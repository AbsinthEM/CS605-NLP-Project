    "# Semantic Persona Classification of USS Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Sentence Transformers and Cosine Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To develop and evaluate a semantic-based machine learning model that classifies Universal Studios Singapore (USS) user reviews into six distinct visitor personas â€” **Families**, **Thrill Seekers**, **International Tourists**, **Budget Conscious**, **Premium Visitors**, and **Experience Focused** â€” using sentence transformer embeddings and cosine similarity matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset:\n",
    "Google Reviews collected for Universal Studios Singapore, including textual reviews, star ratings, and temporal metadata spanning multiple years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology:\n",
    "- **Data Loading**: Using pre-processed USS review dataset (cleaned in previous analysis)\n",
    "- **Semantic Embeddings**: Using BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 sentence transformer model with GPU acceleration\n",
    "- **Persona Definition**: Six detailed semantic descriptions with positive and negative indicators\n",
    "- **Batch Processing**: Efficient embedding generation with batch size optimization (512 reviews/batch)\n",
    "- **Classification**: Cosine similarity calculation between review embeddings and persona embeddings\n",
    "- **Enhanced Analysis**: Primary and secondary persona identification with confidence gap calculation\n",
    "- **Results Export**: Dual format output (CSV + Parquet) with full similarity matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "- **Classification Distribution**: Persona percentage breakdown and counts\n",
    "- **Confidence Statistics**: Mean, median, min, max confidence scores per persona\n",
    "- **Mixed Persona Analysis**: Detection of users with confidence gaps < 0.05\n",
    "- **Uncertainty Detection**: Reviews with confidence gaps < 0.1 requiring validation\n",
    "- **Cross-Persona Patterns**: Most common primary-secondary persona combinations\n",
    "- **Star Rating Correlation**: Validation against user satisfaction scores\n",
    "- **High-Confidence Sampling**: Top examples per persona for quality assessment"
