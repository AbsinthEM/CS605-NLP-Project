As a result you might had to pay locker charges. Food and selling items are very expensive even a polithin rain coat cost SGD 5. Vegitarion meal is over SGD 15. Express entry price also much more higher and it is even costly than the entrance ticket. Its better to book ticket from your hotel (bit cheap: SGD 71). Better only bring your ticket and some cash to spend to avoid paying a big amount for lockers if you stuck in a queue. Also, no need of water bottles as water dispensers are everywhere. Other than than these issues most of the activities are mind blowing.",

The fans are only there for show, more than half of them do not work and therefore it is hot and stuffy. Everything is not just expensive, I think you cant find more expensive anywhere in the world. The rides are not from the last century, but even from the century before last, and after standing in line for an hour or more, it can close for an unknown reason because it is broken. There is only fast food, and the most expensive in the world, no choice, only chicken and incomprehensible potato balls. Everything is spicy, unacceptable for Europeans. I do not even consider local food like noodles. In 6 hours spent on this Sentosa we visited only 2 rides, and as I said earlier we left one because it was broken. Money wasted. Basically, after buying tickets you just end up in a bunch of shops selling stuffed toys made in China. There are probably more of these shops here than cafes and rides combined.",

Other projects are either not fun at first glance, or they have to wait in a long line to enter and find that they are not fun at all...the food is also expensive and tastes terrible! Among the tourist attractions in Singapore, Universal Studios is the one with the lowest value for money and the worst experience; compared to famous amusement parks in other countries, it also ranks last!

The single game, with a wait for exactly an hour. I played two games and it rained heavily. We entered the Brest Halal restaurant and sat for two hours and went out and played for another hour. The important thing is that it rained. They stopped the outdoor games for adults, and we entered movie shows and a single game game at 4:30. They said. We went out for a while to play games. The price is 82 dollars. We took it from the hotel for 80 dollars, a small amount other than in America. The problem is that it is not worth the amount for those who take the Fast Pass, but when you are a family that is separated, if you are thinking about going, the weather must be clear. The second thing is to wait. May God help you with the smell of sweat because it is hot, and take the fast path.",

There is no limitation of rides you take once you enter and the place is open till 5 PM Do not go for TREASURE HUNT ride because it has nothing exciting to offer and is just a waste of time. You will definitely regret taking this ride. You can do so many other things instead. This was our only disappointment during our visit.",

It's a relatively small place and if you are not someone who enjoys rides or shows, this would be a waste of time and money. The rollercoasters and rides we tried were good. We do recommend going for Transformers and Revenge of the Mummy. Please expect long wait times for most rides unless you have a express or unlimited pass, for which of course, you shell out more. The show at WaterWorld was the highlight of our trip to USS. Definitely one of the best, if not the only thing we felt was worth going for. The prices for food and drinks are simply exorbitant inside. So prepare accordingly. There are lockers conveniently provided outside every ride to keep your bags. We also recommend going on weekdays. Even though we went on a Monday, there was still quite a crowd. So weekends are likely to be worse. All in all, it is probably worth a one time visit to see what the fuss is all about, but it is unlikely we will return.",

As a family of three, we also paid another 121SPD entry fee for the aquarium and for the photo that you were allowed to take at the entrance (free), you would of course have paid 65SPD at the end of the tour, packaged as a souvenir. The aquarium was ok, I've seen bigger ones. The jellyfish were the most impressive thing for me. We would also have liked to visit Delphine Island, but we would have had to pay the entrance fee there too. All in all, in my opinion it wasn't worth the price we paid. I am very disappointed.

We went on 2nd day of supposed minions themed experience but the minion land was not even open! It takes up nearly half of the park and is still under construction. What a rip off!! Too hot, no areas to cool down, very few and overpriced food options, insanely long waits for underwhelming rides. There are only roughly 10 total rides in operation now. We basically left after less than 4 hours. Would have more enjoyment to watch my money burn in fire pit on beach! Dont waste your time! If you are expecting a disney like experience prepare to be let down!",

If you purchase the Express Pass for over 7 million VND, you wont need to wait in lines everywhere. However, if you opt for regular tickets, be prepared to queue for each ride, which can take anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes, sometimes even with 100 people ahead of you! The term rides here doesnt necessarily mean actual games; it often refers to attractions where you sit and enjoy the experience. Universal Studios offers various themed areas, including NYC, Transformers, Ancient Egypt, Jurassic Park, and Far Far Away (soon to have a Minion land). However, there arent too many games. If you visit, prioritize the Jurassic Park ride (remember to bring a raincoat from homeit costs 10,000 VNDbecause the 6 SGD per person fee here will leave you as wet as a soaked mouse! ). Next, try the Transformer ride (it felt so real that it made my heart skip a beat). Theres also an impressive show that recreates an action scene from JAWS, directed by Steven Spielberg. Its fantastic, although experiencing 2-3 scenes instead of just 1 would be even more satisfying! For younger visitors, the other attractions are more relaxed. Universal Studios has several roller coasters, but unfortunately, my digestion and heart arent up to the task, so I couldnt review them. Overall, the 1.4 million VND per person price tag for an experience comparable to what youd find in the United States didnt leave me completely satisfied. Id rate it a 7 out of 10. Heres hoping for a Disneyland visit someday to add to my reviews!",

There is an express line for the games with price tag of 3times the normal price tag, which I found exorbitant. But the sectors like hollywood, Jurassic world , waterworld and four others - they all give your money's worth. You must ride the rollercoasters particularly the roller coaster named cyclone but I would strongly recommend those with neck and head injury or if you have some kind of trouble in your heart , not to indulge . Other than these there are many options in the pyramid that is the Egypt segment or the Sci-Fi segment I would recommend everyone to watch them. There are various segments with heater is I personally 8 and patriot Jurassic world overall there are 7-8 restaurants. There are other food stalls and drink stalls as well. There are numerous stalls where mementos are available with the sticker of the logo of universal studios those things are dam costly I mean food be interested in buying a minion 6 to 7 inches soft toy with a price tag of around 30 US dollars!!! Not me. But the design of the whole amusement park is amazing and with just a single ticket you can virtually spend the whole day with your family. I think it's a must see if you go to Singapore.",

It's overpriced for the number and length of the rides and impossible to enjoy without the express pass. The rides themselves are mostly entertaining, but extremely short. The park was also quite well managed with enthusiastic staff to help at every turn. Speaking of the express pass. We purchased ours in advance expecting to be able to take all rides using it. Unfortunately, the freshly opened Minions section of the park required yet another upgraded express pass on arrival. Looking at the attractions in that section, we decided we'd spent enough at this park. In addition to that, transport to the island is completely inadequate for the number of visitors. Given the cost of any of the attractions, I don't expect to be shoved into a two-car monorail and covered in the sweat of others before I even arrive. This needs a serious upgrade. Take a quick look at the Disney parks in Hong Kong or Tokyo for inspiration. The rides to those parks are comfortable and inspire you to have fun with its decor. This one just feels like it's squeezing your wallet open by packing you into the train. On a final note, the food was some of the best we've had at a theme park. Typically parks like these serve scraps at best, but it was actual restaurant food here. Well done on that!",

Unfortunately, Universal Singapore doesn't have enough rides or even shows to be entertained. There were a few rides out of comision which didn't help the lack of rides. That said, we did enjoy ourselves, but we wanted for more. We paid for express plus tickets at entry. Do not waste your time or money. We did not feel that it was worth it. The park was too short, and lines were short, and we found that we didn't really save time by getting in the express line.",

The price is quite inflated and there are continuous costs. For instance I was told I should put my backpack in a locker so I paid 35 dollars outside the park to put my bag away and just kept a small cross body bag for my wallet. Then when you try and go on certian rides you thin need to buy a locked in the park for your smaller item and suddenly one ride is costing you 15 so you can store your bag for it. So if your alone this is an expensive day of storing your items and if your with people expect one person to sit out and wait with your bags The food as all theme parks go was of course over priced. But this is a pretty well known fact so always eat before and bring snacks. The size of the park is quite small compared to others and the majority of the rides were more or less 4d so your just sitting in a cart rattling with screens around you more than anything really. I do not recommend buying tickets at the gate as I found them through tour companies much cheaper",

We had the option to stay in line but they couldn't provide a timescale for the fix. We tried to go back later in the day but we heard an announcement from outside that there was a 'short delay due to a fault'. That was the same message we heard repeatedly in the morning which had turned into an extended delay. We tried 'Battlestar Galactica' but that was closed for the entire day due another fault. As a result the queues for the other major rides where in excess of 2 hours each. As a family we decided to try the queues as 'single riders', where available, in the hope of getting on quicker. For the Transformer 3D ride we were warned that we'd have to wait 30 minutes. It ended up being 55 minuted. As a result we only went on about 5-6 rides all day. I felt robbed given how much we'd paid to get in. It's easy to identify ways that this park could shorten the queues. An extra member of staff on each ride would make the changeover a lot quicker. Also on the drink stalls, my wife queued for 15 minutes to get a slush because there was 1 person taking the money and preparing the drinks. If one person sorted the payment and a 2nd person prepared the drinks the queues would be a fraction of the size. It annoys me that these places charge the earth and provide such poor service.",

Smoking areas/drinking fountains/restrooms are a bit worn out here and there, but there were no inconveniences in using them. On days when the weather is nice, it seems to be physically and mentally beneficial to buy an express ticket. Unlike in Korea, there is a mindset that if you pay a premium price, you will naturally receive preferential treatment. The taste of the restaurants here and there was average, and the facilities were also so-so. I think it's a place worth visiting at least once when you visit Singapore.",

Although many of them can communicate in Chinese, they don't smile much and their answers are not very patient. I also feel that the staff's adaptability (or work attitude) is not up to par. I queued for nearly 90 minutes for Transformers and when I got there (about 10 people left in front), I had already seen the car. At this time, the facility actually broke down (sorry)! The announcement kept saying that they didn't know when it would be repaired, so I had to wait for nearly 30 minutes. During this period, a bunch of impatient customers kept trying to leave from the back, but the staff on the scene didn't know where to go, causing the scene to be chaotic. This made people have a bad impression and really needs to be improved.",

You can purchase an express pass once inside the park to skip queues but on the day of our visit, it was S70 extra which was only a little less than the normal park admission. You really have to want to ride those rides multiple times to justify that amount of money. Word of advice, queue up for transformer ASAP.

There was nothing an adult could do in Hollywood, Madagascar or New York.. that leaves us with just a few more parks to go and not all has exhilarating outdoor rides, some just have boring indoor rides, only parent with kids would go there. To top it up it was raining and due to the lightning alert, they closed the outdoor rides from 3pm to 5.30pm. The entire place shuts at 7pm which gave us less time to complete our outdoor rides. And when the rides finally opened up, of course everyone rushed to the queue, we waited 40 minutes for each ride and only managed 2 roller coaster rides. I think when such safety hazards surface (which is of course out of their hands) its only fair that they allow an extra hour for the park to be open, for us who paid full fare to at least make use of the ticket and have a good experience. Also, the staff were completely uninterested from the entrance onwards. A fun park is usually expected to have some motivation, fun faces, fun pitch intonations, enthusiastic participation etc..to create a hype among the visitors there.. but most of them were just mundane, bored with their job, not even a hi when we entered a ride. I could count the numbers of staff who were enthusiastic and sadly that was only about 10%. Its a shame that Universal Studio Singapore doesnt stand up to other Universal Studios around the world, and its one of the most global countries in South East Asia.",

We spend all day and it was not enough to try all the attractions. Also, only 4 or 5 were interesting, others were only for children. The funny thing was that almost all the time we were obligated to leave our stuff in lockers and these lockers were for free only for 30-40minutes. After that there was 4 dollars fee for every 20 minutes. But almost all the time we had to wait for the attraction for more that 1 hour, so it was so unfair. It is not worth to pay so much money for this experience!!!",

The wait time for every ride/show is mentioned at entry gate so you can plan accordingly. Transformer 4D,revenge of mummy were my beat ones. Discovery food court has limited options, you might try out other food options. But do get a coke for yourself from discovery food court, it will get you a Universal studios sipper, additional souvenir if you want. Lockers are available free of cost for most of the rides. The most amazing part is, that even if you are in queue for a ride/show, don't worry about convenience. They keep you engagaed, and under AC chambers. 40-50 mins are not a problem here. There is also free wifi covering most part. Plenty of shopping opportunities, almost after every ride/show. Madagascar (ride) is smooth and good for anyone. This is Universal Studios for you. Spend as much time as you can. They have taken care of every little details. This is separate from Sentosa, which requires another full day by the way.",

There were many attractions and had something for everyone in the family. My favorite was Transformer's Ultimate 3D Battle Ride. We had to wait because of the long queue but it was worth it. And you won't get bored. Everybody was so excited. The Revenge of the Mummy was jaw-droppimg. I also enjoyed Spielberg's Lights, Camera, Action. I love the Minions! We enjoyed dining at the Jurassic Park-themed food court and brought my nieces' Universal Studios tumblers so we could buy soda at a discounted price. There was so much to explore.

The way the staff dealt with it was also very rude and they rushed tourists away, which was very bad! Since tickets bought in advance cannot be changed, we can only accept Universal's statement that \"the company has the right to change the time.\" Although Japan Global is more expensive, the service is much better than in Singapore. Singapore Global's service and handling methods are really terrible. For a large global company, Singapore Global's handling is very poor!",

Honestly this was one of the worst paid for 'experiences' we've ever had anywhere in the world. 1.5hrs of queuing for a ride which said it was a 45 min wait at the start. The ride took 7.5 mins. Another one was a 45min wait for a 35 sec ride. Hot, stinky, crowded queues. Two of the family rides weren't even working when the park opened because of what the staff said were technical problems. The kicker is when you do decide to pay the extra 70SGD pp for an 'Express' ticket to jump the queue, they then use surge pricing and say it will cost 140SGD pp (no discount for kids). Even those with Express tickets had to wait 45mins to ride the Jurassic Park Rapids when the average ticket holder had to wait 2hrs. In the midst of this self-punishment I tried to get a beer. Waited in line for 5 mins to get to the front only to be told the 11SGD beer had sold out. I guess there were other desperate adults who'd got there quicker. As well as that when the kids wanted photos with the characters they were told no, only photos taken by professional photographers. Like I said, if you like to wait in line sweating while having your pockets emptied by Universal then you'll love it.",

The rides were slightly different from Orlando which was an added bonus and due to the heat another fantastic day in the 30c we were very pleased to visit Hard Rock Cafe for our ritual Cheeseburger and Coke which was excellent. The Hard Rock Cafe was not the largest we have been to, but the shop was full of excellent T-shirts which makes the prices a bit more acceptable. We got our forearms stamped and went back in to the Studios to do a bit of last minute shopping before heading back into Singapore.",

The receiving area was small so my wife and my kids sat beside the counter together with my sister in law and father in law while I was the one who approach the counter and make order. One of my son was playing with our GO PRO camera,afterward he placed the said camera on the couch beside her mom then one of the staff called us to enter and approach the table they preparedfor us,unknowingly they left the Camera outside but we did not notice it at first, after eating we went out of KT's grill, a few min. And meters away from the resto me and my wife was rushing to go back to get the Camera.As we enter we approach the crew of the resto and they said they haven't seen any camera was left so we call on the manager to ask help if we could review the CCTV cameras of their resto and they said we have to follow the protocol of the eatablishment to report it to the Lost and Found Section and so we follow everything they told us to do. The Lost and found section took our contact # and told us to wait for their call as so we did.By around 5pm one of the staff of the Lost and Found Section called us just to tell us that they could not see the footage in that area where we alleged that the camera was left becauae the camera is in focus to the resto's reception counter only and the full area is not visible. We are so fraustrated with the KT's Grill as you can imagine the people entering there is not safe they cannot protect their customers from those theives around the area of their resto..if you visit the place you can clearly see what i realy ment that their cctv camera could not capture the area of their receiving where they took orders for the mere fact that the area was too small.i am very disappointed!",

There is lack of maintenance, 2 rides broke down & stop during the rides with system failure on my day in. Rude staffs with command acting rather than welcome help. Most of the rides have only 1 staff to operate a ride; Ticket check, Security check, Open-Close doors, Switching On-Off. That's boring wasting time.

Of course the customer is not king, but customers pay money to get their service. So customers hope to receive the service they have purchased like customers, not just receive their money and then ignore it. The staff (especially young people) at various rides on the USS are generally reluctant to provide even the slightest information and are rude even when answering basic questions from customers. For example, when I and other guests approached the entrance to the Cyclon (roller coaster), the staff spoke quickly and their English pronunciation was far from standard so it was difficult to understand, it was only natural for customers to ask \"Excuse me, what do you mean by this is the last hour?\" the staff even got angry and shouted in response while looking away \"10 minutes\" he said. It turned out that the ride was taking a break for 10 minutes and there was no announcement, so many customers continued to come to the ride because they didn't know. Instead of conveying information about the break and when it would reopen, the staff immediately rejected customers curtly. It's not surprising that if other customers asked when it would reopen, the staff answered by shouting, rudely, curtly and angrily while turning around. Interestingly, in contrast to the attraction staff found on the streets in Universal Studios who are warm and smiling. These non-vehicle staff try to greet and smile at every customer passing by and don't even hesitate to ask them to take a group photo. OVERALLS The place is not big. Likewise with the number of rides, it is quite small. The only advantage or attraction of the USS is the roller coaster. If Dufan had a roller coaster that was better or at least the same as USS, of course the experience at USS would be even less memorable. The service from the workers at the rides is bitchy, rude, angry, degrading people who can't understand what they are saying as a sign that the tourists don't speak English, even though the tourists are fluent in English. Even though the experience offered by USS can be enjoyed and some of it is enjoyable, it all disappears or becomes less impressive because of the service provided by the staff who are rude, uninformative, lazy, angry, rude, etc.",

Unfortunately, it was raining. The stunt Waterworld was not shown. I bought the express pass. It is worth it as we went during weekend. But I had the fact that it is much more expensive that the actual ticket and the prices are up according to demand. I think this capitalist approach is quite bad. For that I pull off your star.",

Hosted by Steven Spielberg (New York Zone), also I took Hyper-realistic 3D thrill ride on Transformers The Ride : The Ultimate 3D Battle (Sci-fi City Zone), and the last one I took High speed roller coaster on Revenge of the Mummy (Ancient Egypt Zone).

I have seen a number of staff scolding visitors or raising their voice because they (visitors) dont understand them. 3. Very low frustration tolerance. Staff must understand that some of the visitors are first time theme park goers. Staff have no patience and would even talk to them in a very condescending tone.

It is probably a place I would not want to visit again in an Asian paradise. \"Each\" service staff of the park definitely needs more than 6 months of education and training. Shrek 4D Cinema, when we first entered the theater, the service staff explained that he shushed the guest three times in a row, which was very rude. Then he shushed the guest two more times. Can you not speak? During the 55-minute wait in line for Treasure Hunt, the instrument completely stopped twice. Of course, it is necessary under safety conditions, but the service staff looked indifferent to the guests and did not explain it. Even when the machine stopped for the second time, they looked at each other and laughed, and the guests in line were so sad that they wanted to cry. It ended by picking up an empty can under a game vehicle. Not only did the guests have no interest in playing at this time, but the service staff were still completely stupid, as if the only thing that was interesting was when the machine was down. All of these happened on January 25, 2020. Compared to Hong Kong, which I have visited more than a dozen times, the Japanese Disney service staff are full of smiling professionalism, allowing guests to feel a full atmosphere of joy as soon as they enter the park. \"Universal Studios Singapore is really disappointing.\"",

I suggest that if you can, buy tickets with the S5 meal voucher (cant be used in cart stalls). We had 6 vouchers and it was worth it. We paid extra S0.50 per ticket to get the S5 voucher. I tried the transformer 3D ride. 2 hours queue but it was worth it. My family lined up for the roller coaster and was told it was not working when they got closer at the start of line. There should have been told as soon as possible and given some sort of express pass for something else. They waited for 40 mins.

In the end, the waiting time which was supposed to be 45 mins came up to be nearly 2 hours as they keep letting express pass holders through instead of clearing those who were stuck during the breakdown. Upon returning to the locker immediately after the ride, it was locked up due to expiry of time limit and I was forced to pay a fine to retrieve my belongings despite trying to explain the situation to the locker crew. There weren't any staff that could redress such issues at the BSG. There weren't any staff available along the way as well and I have to make my way all the way back to the ticket entrance customer service. And there was such a long queue that the usher outside the office advised me to come back later. Basically, it is compulsory to place all your belongings in lockers located near the entrance of thrilling rides. I have seen more than a few riders being sent off because they have stuff inside their pockets just before their turn for the ride. You will definitely be bored to death while queuing more than 60 minutes without your mobile phone and stuff, especially if you are a single rider. So be mentally prepared.",

The average wait time during my visit was /- 5 minutes per ride. Looking at the parks history they are adding new attractions regularly. With Battlestar Galactica now reaching an age of 10 years the park is in need of a new thrill-ride to stay relevant for thrillseekers. In my opinion a Spinning-coaster would be a grate addition to the already grate lineup. A rather compact spinning-coaster could fit just perfectly in the upcoming \"Minion Park\". Universal Studios Singapore is worth visiting during a Singapore stay.",

At the Goldilocks eatery, we were given a buzzer for our waffles that never buzzed. 30 minutes later, we went back to the counter and they told us either somebody else took our food or they forgot about our order.

Either way, at this time, you should get the free 6 month season pass with a one-day ticket! The rides overall are fun, especially my favourite being Battlestar Galactica. It's fun, and both for adults and kids. Definitely recommend a Express pass though. Overall, great and fun, but the things there are a little expensive, so bring your own food and drinks (There are water coolers). Bring a poncho, in case of rain and if you want to ride the Jurassic Rapids Adventure. :)",

The only caveat is the waiting time for each attractions especially the popular ones like the transformers and roller coaster which has one of longest waiting time. My advice would be to go to these attractions right after the park opens or go after the rush hours. Also try not to miss the Waterworld show. I hope my review was helpful to you.

One ride can take more than an hour alone, the queue is really big, wow! Even at that time, the queue for Transformers could take 2 hours and Jurassic World 1.5 hours If you have more money, my advice is to use fast track. BTW, there are lots of photo spots guys, for those who prefer to immortalize the moment, don't forget to wear cool ootds and the most important thing is to wear clothes that aren't hot, if possible, bring a hat/umbrella.",

Interestingly, where we didnt see a lot of people, the rides are chock full of them as the waiting time stretches up to 1.5 hrs to 2 hrs, notably due to social distancing and limited number of people can get on the rides due to enforcement of distancing. It is a good thing actually. Kudos to the staff for diligently wiping down every seat and cabin whenever each ride is completed. Timed tickets have to be issued for certain rides as they are overwhelmingly popular. Good idea though as it spaced out the crowd but at the same time created additional long queues to get the tickets.",

Although there are quite a few people inside the park, the number of people who can ride the attractions is strictly limited, so when popular attractions like Revenge of the Mummy get a little crowded, the wait times can get much longer. Since there are only a limited number of attractions in operation, I finished most of the rides and returned home around 4pm, but I think it's the only time there aren't many people, so that was a good thing.",

I tried to call or email Universal Studios/Resorts World to ask them if I could change my son's ticket to a different day. That's where my nightmare began. Hour after hour, throughout the whole night - 2.30am, 3.30am, 4am, 5am, I was emailing back and forth. Each time, a different staff member replied me. I was being shunted from staff member to staff member. One even was dismissive of the whole issue and tried to tell me to check my junk email folder from time to time, in case the confirmation email had been sent there. As if I'd just started using email yesterday! Finally, I went into the park with my son at 5pm, because I didn't want to forfeit his ticket. We only managed a couple of rides, because the park was too full. My experience with Resorts World Sentosa was terrible.",

I was too navie to put my phone in the locker as instructed. Could not recall how I survived 4 hrs queuing without a phone. Many other experienced folks just have their phone with them and still were allowed to ride. Why do they have such instructions in the first place?

Do take note that there are no water dispensers working so its probably better to bring your own drinks. Might be better than buying soft drinks for the whole day. There's also re-entry allowed so you can go out to have a meal before coming in if the food inside is not to your liking. Do inform the exit staff you will be re-entering. Bring umbrellas if its the rainy season. Rain coats not recommended as you will still need to take it off when going for rides. Taking it off and putting it on repeatedly when going for rides is a hassle. It opens until pretty late at night, but basically during dinner time the crowds almost dissipate. If going during peak periods, it is recommended to get express pass. 5 mins per ride is very different from 1-2hrs per ride! You can even take the same ride 6-7 times if so desired. But since you can always buy passes on the spot, you can use your normal ticket, look at the crowd condition on the actual day, then decide if you want to buy express. Hope the above tips helps everyone have a great time there!",

It seems to me to create artificial demand so the park and rides operate at a certain capacity always. I wish it was like lesser known theme parks overseas where rides are walk up and wait for the next turn. Not a queue of minimum 40min. With ticket prices like this already, why cant one make a beeline for Battlestar roller coasters, do 5 consecutive runs, and be out of USS within 1.5hours? Instead, every ride has a queue of at least 30min, and the ride lasts all of 5min. And the lack of drinks station is unbelievable. To buy drinking water, the queue is the same as those ordering food(?!) very long. Why not place vending machines throughout the park, or drinks-only stands. Made worse by the opening time of 2pm, possible heat injury is a real danger! I know this is an attraction, so would pay up to 10 for a 500ml bottle of drinking water, if only there were more stands selling them to ensure no queue for drinks.",

I went on a drizzly Thursday afternoon in April, which meant that there was little or no queues for many of the rides. The longest queue I experienced was around 30 minutes for the Transformers ride, which I visited around 3pm. The wait was alright because the queue passed through various chambers with exhibits & panels before the ride itself. I revisited the Transformers ride at 7pm, and this time there was no queue. A small part of the Universal Studios complex is sheltered (the New York and Sci-Fi sections) in case of rain. There are also numerous indoor rides around. The most thrilling rides are both outdoor Battlestar Galactica rides, and the Mummy indoor ride. There are some other relaxing rides that are more suitable for young children, or those not inclined for thrills. Food & drink is extremely expensive within USS. Do note that ALL the water coolers are not operating (as at April 2021). To get around this, you can consider stashing your own food & drink in your bag to bring into the park. Alternatively, exit the park and ask for a hand stamp for re-entry, before heading out to a 7-11 store or similar places for a quick drink. All in all, not too bad an experience to temporarily feel like you are outside Singapore.",

As it wasnt stated anywhere on the brochure or notice board. We did not know and we blindly went to the other rides, spending a long time queuing up. We missed out on the good stuff. Lets face it, only the Mummy Human & Cylone ride are the best rides in USS. Yet we couldnt get on them. Its really disappointing. There was a free snack which are just chicken nuggets. My friends boyfriend couldnt eat it as hes a vegan so he was really hungry for the entire period of time. We felt really bad as well since there wasnt any vegetarian food for him. The water dispensers were all turned off as well. So youd be forced to buy the 5 water. There should be a sign on the USS website stating what rides are closed, and the other rides that are still operating, their schedules. So people can plan their trip appropriately and instead we just slowly strolled around without knowing all the crucial information. Only go if youre ok with the kiddy rides, Long queues, watered down experience, hot weather & mask wearing for the whole time.",

Understandably, the pandemic has watered down everything to the extent that there is barely any feel of Halloween. They chose to pipe in loud club music instead of scary music, there are no 'scarers' except the social distancing ambassadors that will appear randomly to say '2 in a group ah'. The 'scare alley' was over in 20 seconds? The exhibition was OK and actually quite informative but because there was just so many people I felt pressured to keep walking instead of reading every single infopanel like I usually do (am a museum buff). So many rides were closed, which meant that queues were long (even though kids are having their Os and A levels and on paper there should be less of a crowd). We got the express pass but I shudder to think what would happen if we didn't. We probably get to queue for 2 rides and that's it. I guess that's a scare too. Save your money and catch a horror movie, you'll get more of a kick than coming here ...for now (at least till after the pandemic)",

Rides were high quality and nothing was scary for small child. Cons: heat was high and closed water access means buying lots of water/drinks from food stands. Prices are extortionate, 15 for a fountain drink is near criminal. But you're stuck and have no other options. I'd give 5 stars but this is particularly awful and unforgivable.",

Entered at 12pm and the park was still relatively empty as most humans have not headed in yet. Some rides and shows are currently closed such as Shrek 4D, Lights Camera Action and Waterworld. Some rides started at 12pm such as the Cylons Vs Humans Roller Coaster, Particle Accelerator, Treasure Hunt, Jurassic World Rapids Ride and Madagascar Boat Ride. Some rides starts at 1pm such as Elmo's Spaghetti Adventure and Transformers. Some rides start at 2pm such as Revenge of the Mummy. Much planning is required to ensure the golden hour of 12pm to 1pm is not wasted waiting for rides to open. It was fun trying the different rides and glad that most are not undersized. Going through the rides brought much joy and laughter. Only bad part of going to a theme park, stuck in lines and the poor air circulation. More fans are needed for the long queues. Enjoyed a meal at Louis NY Pizza Parlor bringing back memories of pizza at Julianna's over in DUMBO. Really miss good pizza. Drinks are crazy expensive too at SG5 a cup. Glad that the free tickets came with 2 x 5 meal voucher and 2 x 5 off with min spend of SG25 meal voucher to help offset the cost of the food and drinks. All in a great day of fun and reminder why theme parks are not in my travel plans. Just do not like dealing with long queues for 1 to 2 mins of mirth. Not a place for bigger sized persons as all theme parks are loathe to do.",

So, due to the ongoing pandemic, many food outlets were closed and also many attractions like the Lights Camera Action one, the Shrek 4D and the shows. And there was a lack of street side entertainment. So no Disney-style parades. Meet and Greets are also fairly detached and impersonal, you can't hug any of their characters for example. Hope to see this park get up from the doldrums and start shining bright like it once did, soon!",

Overall a nice day out to explore USS sg again, its not a big USS at all compared to others like in Japan but still worth coming once a while",

Read this review first: We paid 4 tickets plus 4 express tickets at full price and went on Thursday 24 March 2022. This was our sons birthday present and their first ever USS experience going on rides. When we got there however we discovered that all the shows are closed (all incl. Waterworld, Shrek, ALL of them). Lights, Camera, Action ride is also closed. The food court is closed. Some of the restaurants were closed. Half the food trucks are closed. All water fountains are turned off. One has to walk half-way across the park to buy overpriced water. We queued for 15mins to buy 1 slush beverage even though we were just third in line. We waited another half hour to order pizza at one of the few restaurants that are open...and mind you, it was NOT crowded and there were just 4 guests in front of us, max. Finally, the website advertises a Madagaskar parade. Beware, that was not a parade. They were just a couple of dancers and 3 Madagaskar characters dancing at one spot. There is no parade as advertised. They also do not inform on their website that all the shows are closed. Also 2 rides were closed temporarily due to technical issues. And they also halted the outdoor rides for about 30mins due to lightning risk (we never heard any lightning nor did it ever rain). Overall the rides are still great but paying full price for getting just half the experience is very, very poor, and very disappointing. Ive been to the Universal Studios park many times in the US and in Singapore and THIS was the worst experience Ive ever had. I highly believe that this lack of service goes against the culture of the real Universal Studios corporation (they would never allow that). Like another user puts it, this is a complete rip-off. Just take peoples money and dont care to deliver. Shameful.",

So many youngsters queuing in the express lanes without tickets and were let through, while honest people queue for an hour or more in long snaking queues. The eateries, with reduced capacity, also had long queues just to get in. Even the slushee cart had an hour long queue. Only to be told the machine couldnt cope and only 2 unpopular flavour, and even then it had to be made with ice from one machine, and syrup from another. Overall, was there at 11:30 till closing time. Total ride time was no more than 30mins. The rest was spent queuing and walking from point to point. The attraction did not put in any effort to handle capacity crowd while letting in as many people as they possibly could. Waterworld was closed but not boarded up. Looks desolated. Madagascar will also be closed for refresh. Best to avoid until management does a better job at planning.",

However, the 1 star review is to reflect: 1. All water dispensers are shut off, which according to customer services, is due to covid-19. However, given that I have been able to use water taps to fill water bottles at gyms and other attractions in Singapore, this is clearly not a legitimate reason. It's just because resort just wants its customers to spend more money (min 4/bottle) on buying water. Even the restaurants are not allowed to provide tap water, which clearly has nothing to do with covid. Having already spent 70 - 80 per person on tickets. It is not fair to expect a family of 4 to spend 20 - 40 extra on water during the day.The extra waste generated is also terrible for the environment. 2. The 'farewell' show at the end of the day was cancelled due to 'heavy rain' (it was barely drizzling), yet the resort failed to even remove the sign advertising the event, meaning we stayed around an extra hour just to be disappointed.",

However, the place is beautifully decorated and every location is insta worthy and we took a looooot of pictures. The snacks were also pretty good. The corn dogs and fried chicken were some of my favourites. For a good visit, plan ahead for the weather and the order to visit things. Research on the rides and see which ones you definitely want to do and what you could dk with . You could rush at 6:59 to the more popular rides to skip the queue but the moment the clock turns 7:01 they no longer allow more people. Furthermore, by booking with Kkday (which I did) you get a 10% retail discount voucher, a free ice cream with set meals voucher and a 5 off any individual meal voucher (min 10) .

The only downside? The waiting time and the queue for the rides (of which, there aren't that many to begin with, so if you come here expecting to ride 10 rollercoasters, nuh uh, not happening). If you arrive early and choose the sequence of your rides carefully, you can avoid long waits and complete your tour around the place within 3-4 hours (cue a cumulative sigh of relief, we all dread the Singapore heat).",

Cleanliness: leaves at many places/corners. It really look like theres no cleaning regime or the frequency has been reduced. Dirty. an ugly sight. Really. 2. Show, places for visit, attractions: many are closed. U can see from the photo, the food court is closed, the carts are closed mostly, the attractions are closed, some show are cancelled. Really, wonder why they still charged 98 sgd for an adult for this. Things that can be done in uss, reduced tremendously. Not worth the price. 3. Renovation: part of the theme park is closed. As such, the route is a mess. Sign put up for guiding visitors are..... not sure is for confusing the visitors or to help.... They are pointing to... dont know where. Really. I spent a lot of time walking here and there just to go to one place to another. Bad planning. Really. Again, why uss still charge so high if part of the park is renovating...? Puzzled... 4. Generally condition: the place is run down. Attractions, sign, boards.... Many of the Color faded. Need a revamp. 5. Ride experience: feels like the park is design to let visitors wait. For example, the dino flying ride. The poor lady 1 pax need to: (1) start stop the ride, (2) check and scan the express pass (which actually should be checked at the entrance to the queue, but it was done at the entrance to the ride. Waste time), (3) check the visitors exit correctly (waste time), (4) remind visitors to wear mask, cannot split ride... many of these steps can be done parallel, but not possible if it is just 1 staff. Management really need to think what they want the visitors to experience. If the objection is to stall the visitor by letting them queue more, they had succeeded. 6. On covid effort: signs are put up by uss to remind visitors to wear mask when in ride areas. But many visitors did not wear, no staff enforcing this. I guess the sign is for show. The site stated that uss put in enhanced smm, but.... Never implement. The whole afternoon while I was there, I did not see any disinfection done (against what was claimed on the website stating increased cleaning and disinfection. Not sure where did they disinfect. Side track, my recent visit to river safari, the staff disinfect the ride every round. Difficult, but they do what they said. Seriously, after my visit to uss, instead of full peace of mind.. I have full worry of mind. We are living with covid. But it doesnt mean the park can relax to a point that say one thing (Sg clean?), but do another ... Generally, instead of a park that is worth 98sgd per visit, feels more like 18sgd... Can see the staff are friendly. Trying their best. But... gosh, the management need to support the park man..... Sad. Disappointed.",

Much smaller than most other theme parks in the world, but they still manage to pack a decent amount into such a tiny place.

The longest time we waited was 15 minutes, as opposed to the regular queues which went up to as much as 115 minutes. If you can afford it then it will definitely enhance your experience. There was only half of the food and beverage outlets open - which resulted in probably the longest wait Id experienced all day. Took me about 15 minutes to place my order and another 20 to receive it. There are other food/drink carts around the park but these only sell snacks or drinks. Pretty much all shows are still cancelled, including Waterworld. Its obvious the park is not fully operational (pre-covid) yet, but hopefully it gets back to this soon. Looking forward to my next visit at Universal Studios Singapore.",

Without the express ticket you will be stuck in 1h and 30 minutes for an attraction that is not even worth at the end. Many shops were empty, like abandoned?! Also the merchandising shops offered a very poor selection and bad quality merch. Considering the extremely high prices, its definitely not worth it. PLEASE BE AWARE with 70 you only buy 1 express ride to each attraction which is absolutely ridiculous and not competitive with the other theme parks. Will not be back.",

The equipment course itself is short, but it seems to be quite worthwhile. There are also well-equipped restrooms in various places. I think there are regular and express tickets (I didn't make a reservation). I used the non-unlimited express service on Sunday and there were some people. I know the price is about twice the difference, but I think it's worth taking the express. While waiting to use the machine, many of the express waiting lines have air conditioning indoors, and even if they are outdoor lines, there are fans turned on. As for the regular ticket lines, many of them have outdoor waiting lines, and (compared to the express) you can often see places without fans in the waiting line. From 13:30, it seems that some of the rides don't run, probably because it's the employees' lunch time. They seem to start running again at 14:30, but the line is very long. Even for the famous ride, even though it was Express at that time, there was a wait of about 20 to 30 minutes. The amusement park itself is not very big and the course is not long. If you are going with friends and lovers rather than with children, I don't think you need the unlimited express ticket. If you go out in the middle of the day, they will put something like a UV stamp on your forearm, and it looks like you can go out and eat lunch and then come back in. It wasn't very fun or anything. Oh, and I get motion sickness. If you have something like that under your ears, put it on. When it closes, the line for the MRT or train in front is very long, so you need to pay in advance and leave early (last photo)",

So it can be really frustrating to spend half the time in the park waiting. 3. We got the unlimited ride express pass, and it cut the queueing time down to 10-20mins on average. But yes, you still need to queue up despite spending 90 extra per pax. All rides are shared among regular and express lane ticket holders, it's just that the express lane usually has a shorter queue. 4. You may not actually play all the rides more than once or twice due to time constraints and exhaustion. So it's probably difficult to fully utilize the unlimited express pass. 5. Most of the rides are unexciting and catered for kids and family except Human and Cyclon, the Mummy indoor ride, Transformer...

Many were closed or under maintnance and the queues were long at transformers ride, nearly 1.15 hours and food and drinks are costly than outside as expected. Overall had a good experience",

Two thrilling rides: Cylone and Human, with a special mention for Cylone . Transformers is also a must-do, an intense 3D adventure . Less of a fan, but the rest of the family loved: Mummy's Revenge. Otherwise, a lovely park atmosphere with legendary universes: Shrek, Jurassic Park, Transformers... and the Minions sliding everywhere! The outdoor scenery suffers from the weather, but everything inside is impeccable. During our visit, the entire Madagascar universe was under construction, so we'll have to go back... A short day is more than enough. Wait times can be very long, and flow isn't always optimal. Food is at the heart of the concept, as in all parks! We ate a family meal for four at Loui's NY Pizza Parlor. The food and prices were very reasonable. Enjoy!",

It was really fun to run through the darkness like Indiana Jones at Disney in Japan There is a line for people who ride alone at the boarding area, but if you choose this option, you will be able to ride the attraction with a great shortcut.

With that, we were afraid, that we wont finish the attractions, as the park opens at 11AM and closes 6PM. But no worries guys. Madagascar theme park is closed. So was Tresure hunting, Jurrasic world beside the carousel for 5 years old. Waterworld is non existing too, and nothing else provided. Waiting time at battle star galactica 140 (!!!) minutes. Not because too much people, but because every 10 minutes a car was started. Add on the disappointed faces from all the peoples as practically only Transformers and Battlestar were open for grown peoples. The meet and greets just an obligation, the shops providing nothing what you cannot buy at amazon or Ali. Save your 300 dollar for 4 persons and visit something else.

Rides like \"The Revenge of The Mummy\" were quite good and worth the queueing time in our opinion. Food and drinks within USS are also quite expensive so do bring your own snacks and drinks if you wish. Most rides have free lockers at the side for you to put your bags. One thing is that some staff working within the rides are quite impatient.

Restaurants were pack during lunch time (I tried the butter chicken Briyani at Oasis resturant SGD 16 on average, small portion thus I ended up snacking on 6 corndog and 7 coconut drinks from the pushcart) Gift shop was so attractive that I bought some items thou Im a local Size of theme park is not big compared to Usa Australia Korea Japan themepark that I been to However, the performance was great and most importantly good experience.

The express system also makes the estimated \"waiting line\" unpredictable. 40 minutes can easily become 2 hours, as almost nobody is allowed in besides the express card holders. You get the poor children crying and sleeping tired into their parents arms, while the 15 year old rich laugh about the poor mass waiting, and stating that these poor people in the waiting line are crazy (and they are right...).

It's been awhile since i went to USS for the daytime fun as past few years have only been attending the HHN instead. So it was some awesome time spent with loved ones. We got there about noon and still managed to get on the major rides and some of the lesser known ones. So for those who wants to cover all the rides, it's best to come early from their opening hours at 11am. And if you have the budget, get the express entry for all these rides. Of all the major rides, i loved the Cylon (Battlestar Galactica), Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers and the jurassic park rapids adventure. The jurassic park one is slightly different from the one at universal hollywood. From the size of the boat to some parts of the ride itself. But it is still a thrilling one nonetheless. The cylon was such a crazy one. The adrenaline rush is mind blowing. Likewise for the mummy and transformers too. For those who are more on the timid side, they can try the treasure hunter or the accelerator. For quite the movie experience, visit the lights, camera, action to feel the wrath of a cat 4 typhoon but be careful as you may get wet. Or for quite the \"ride\" shrek 4d is another favourite. I didn't get to ride some of the other rides due to time constrained and also was getting tired and just wanna hang out at the beach after that. While some parts are closed for renovation/upgrades. And for those who are still afraid to experience the rides m all (although it's a waste if u do), there are several instagrammable places to take pics.",

I must tell the truth. The main problems are as follows: 1. It is obvious that USSG laid off too many staff at the beginning of the epidemic, and currently the playground is facing a serious staff shortage. The staff lacks training and there is a serious shortage of labor. Although every staff member works hard, their fatigue can be clearly felt. There is no staff to manage the team, and some rides (The Mummy, Galactica, etc.) must be stored, but no one informed them in advance. Staff can only perform management at the project entrance, and there will be no extra staff to maintain order during this period. 2. There are insufficient restaurants, insufficient mobile vendors, insufficient vending machines, and insufficient direct drinking water points. There are too few staff at the catering sales points to serve the large number of tourists, and the speed is very slow, resulting in long queues. 3. The park area is too small and there are too many maintenance projects. Some projects, such as the jeep-riding parent-child project, can be completely stopped. 4. Transformers The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle, a projector was damaged during New Years Day! ! ! ! ! Resulting in dark and heavy shadows in the image. This is a serious performance accident, and it is an irresponsible behavior for the project to continue operating despite such problems! ! ! ! ! ! ! 5. Due to its lack of operational capabilities, Battlestar Galactica completely failed to reflect its design intentions, and it was also an irresponsible behavior towards tourists. One of the selling points of the Battlestar Galactica project is that the two roller coasters stagger forward and backward, which requires the two trains to cooperate in the departure time, but currently due to lack of manpower, this has not been reflected at all. 6. The useless Fast Pass. The official website states that the pass is only valid for 2 hours after the start of operation, but there is no time limit on actual sale and use, and unclear information can cause many problems. At the same time, not all Fast Pass locations can be used, and the sales quantity is not controlled. At certain times, there may be more Fast Pass players than normal queue players. 7. The attitude of the restaurant staff is extremely bad. There is no one to manage the queue. The staff who pre-registered the order made a driving gesture to us for no reason, intending to make us go to another queue. This is extremely insulting and reflects the extremely low level of park management, because I believe the staffs intention is not to insult tourists but they are obviously not trained. 8. The store SKU is too old and all IPs are not competitive. If the selling point of usj Japan is Harry Potter, then ussg has no idea. 9. The maintenance time of Water World is too long, and it has not been repaired for how long. It took such a long time to repair a project in such a large area in such a small park. 10. Entry into the park was also quite chaotic. Tourists queued up spontaneously at first without any guidance from staff, but in the end, the number of queues became more than a dozen, and no one guided the queue in advance. US SG's evaluation should be benchmarked against amusement parks. If usj's overall evaluation is 5 points, then ussg can only score 3 points, which is too much. If Tokyo Disney has an overall score of 5, then ussg can only give 2 points. Tourists and staff are full of fatigue. The operational level of ussg is not comparable to that of Happy Valley. I think it is a pity. For the Chinese, most of the first batch of Chinese people to learn modern management knowledge came through the window of Singapore, but I dont know why the current management is like this.",

In 5 hours we only managed to do 4 attractions lasting a few minutes.

With at least Waterworld closed, I was still not able to enjoy all the rides I wished to get onto due to the lengthy waiting times. 60mins easily feel like 3hours when you're with an impatient and grumpy 7year old. I missed out on the \"big\" ones( high speed roller coaster etc) which I really wanted to get onto due to their long waiting times of at least 90mins each. The day I went was not a public holiday/Christmas day/New Year's day. Food queues are lengthy as well. With that said, rides/attractions were mostly enjoyable once you get onto them (with a few exceptions). Will I go there soon? No. Did I enjoy myself? Neutral. The takesaway for me is to go there after the \"post COVID release\" novelty wears off if I were to do it again.",

I have been going to Orlando for several years, but Singapore is not worthy of the name. It feels chaotic (you have no idea where you are and/or where to go) and it lacks a soul.

I hesitated a lot to buy it (family of 5, it's a budget!), and I ultimately didn't take it because we came on a weekday outside of school holidays. (Please note that you can buy it once there if necessary if you are hesitant). There are quite a few people but it's manageable (up to 50 minutes for certain attractions, or even a little more at the end of the day). You should carefully check the waiting times for attractions with the park app throughout the day. Times can vary quite a bit from one attraction to another throughout the day. So adapt your program accordingly. The most disappointing thing is that they don't always put wait times correctly. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's not. Avoid backpacks as much as possible because some attractions (especially thrill rides) prohibit it and you will have to waste time putting your bags in lockboxes which may be chargeable depending on the time and/or the attraction you are doing. I would have avoided taking one if I had known. Overall, on a day like today (3/16/23), you can do almost all the interesting attractions (by which I mean either thrill rides if that's your thing, or softer ones, especially for young children). It's difficult, however, to do everything without the fastpass, even without a lunch break). If you don't have much time, or you prefer to pay the price to get the most out of it, don't hesitate to take the fastpass unlimited. Wifi is much appreciated to help pass the time in queues. The food there is quite expensive and not particularly good quality. (It is normally forbidden to bring food). For thrill rides, I recommend in order: Transformers, Battle Stars Cyclone, Revenge of the Mummy, Jurrassic Park Rapid Adventure. Shrek 4d and adventures airways aren't bad either. Enjoy!",

It was a very frustrating experience when we ask for some concessions for the closed rights, they simply reject other request and told us there is nothing they can do. I shared the same experience from many people. They faced the same issue. So I think they are doing this intentionally to save some money.",

Many parts of the park were closed and it was the same with the food shops, so choices are limited.

For some of the nicest roller coasters you can't have anything in your pockets. You first need to go to the lockers which are free for a certain time. Then you need to go to the correct waiting line. I really dislike their system with the Universal Express tickets. Not only because you make people willing/able to spend more money more important, it also slows down the whole process as the staff first need to check those tickets, mark them, count the people they let in first before allowing the normal people waiting in line... it annoyed me more and more during the day. I know I can complain but there are a lot of people with enough money, seeing the number of people using it, so they never going to change this system We didn't see a lot of the rest of the park because there was no time for it. So spend your time wisely. We really liked the Battlestar Galactica, the Mummy and the Shrek movie.",

They have locker system, which they give for 40 mins free, but since every ride has a waiting of nearly 2 hours. You end up paying the fees after 40 mins. Which makes no sense. Rides aren't that great. The one's that are mostly shut all time. If the park is flooded like this, none can enjoy. A sheer waste of money. There are barely any cafes serving veg options.",

When we visited waterfront and some other rides were closed, which is very disappointing. Also we realised on week day also there was minimum 20 minutes waiting, for some rides the wait time goes even for 100 minutes, so we were forced to buy purchase express line ticket. Human and Cylon rides are for those who likes the roller coaster rides. Specially the Cylon is not for faint hearted people. Return of Mummy is also very good ride. At 6'00pm the park is closed and so all the eateries inside the park. So it's bit inconvenient, specially when you need food after the tiring day you have to walk all the way to the exit gates. The Steven Spielberg show is good, but there is no seating arrangements, you have to stand for 15 minutes. It's a not bad experience, but definitely not great!",

I arrived at 12pm and left at 630pm and only had 4 rides, namely Mummy, Jurassic Waterfalls, Transformers and junior roller coaster. This was on a weekday. Each ride probably lasted at best 5 minutes. Transformers was also not updated and it was exactly the same thing I experienced 5 years ago. Hence, don't recommend it if you have come before.

The park is quite small, and the entrance fee is quite expensive, especially considering the limited number of attractions. Even on a Monday outside of the school holidays, the wait times for all the rides were long, ranging from 50 to 120 minutes. One major issue I noticed was the poor maintenance of the park. The exterior paintwork was faded, and many attractions had broken elements, from minor things like malfunctioning TV screens in the queues to more significant issues like the broken robot dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park ride. Furthermore, all the attractions in this park felt like inferior versions of similar rides in other parks worldwide. It seemed like little effort was made to provide something unique. Additionally, the toilets were unclean, and the food was expensive. The staff seemed to put minimal effort into ensuring efficient queue management. Platforms were overcrowded, and the staff was unfriendly on multiple occasions. It felt like they were simply going through the motions. One aspect that added to the frustration was the necessity to purchase an express pass. The regular queue lines moved at an excruciatingly slow pace, making it feel almost mandatory to buy an express pass to avoid spending the entire day waiting in line. Overall, I got the impression that little attention was given to visitor experience. Hopefully, the park can make improvements in the future to meet visitor expectations and enhance the overall quality of attractions and service. Please feel free to make any further adjustments to the text if desired.",

If you are going with kids and spending substantial money to get in, spend a bit more always get a express ticket to cut short the line time for the rides.(coz a kid would not understand that one needs to wait in queue to get a spot on the ride) 3. Always get the universal studios Singapore app as it keeps you posted about the ride time in different regions of the park. It also tell you about your real time position and relative distance to a nearest ride. 4. Better to go the park as early as it open. It gets hot and humid so be prepared for that.",

The arrangements for the wait areas were pathetic, if they expect these many people they should atleast make the whole waiting area air conditioned ! It was hot & humid in the queuing areas with a very few fans and people were literally dying of heat ! The park should limit the number of people allowed so everyone can enjoy who has paid this much amount to get a ticket. The people with express ticket obv had an edge at the expense of people with regular tickets, but the express ticket prices are ridiculous ! We were only able to get on 2-3 rides in the whole day and kids were exhausted and bored due to long queues. Many food courts were closed and the ones that were available had average food, out of stock and priced at a level of fine dine ! It was supposed to be a fun day but turned out to be a torture !",

                  "review_text": "I recently visited Universal Studios in Singapore with my family and close family members with high hopes of an unforgettable day filled with excitement and adventure. Unfortunately, my experience was marred by one glaring issue: the absurdly long queues. It's disheartening to say that my overall impression of Universal Studios was one of frustration and disappointment. Upon arrival, it was immediately evident that the park was overcrowded. The lines for popular attractions stretched endlessly, resembling a never-ending labyrinth of waiting. It felt like the park management had completely overlooked the importance of efficient crowd control and guest satisfaction. Even with a carefully planned itinerary, I found myself spending the majority of my time (more than one or 2 hours)standing in lines rather than enjoying the attractions. It was disheartening to see families and children growing increasingly tired and restless while waiting for their turn, dampening the excitement that should have been synonymous with a theme park visit. To make matters worse, the queuing experience was poorly managed, resulting in excessive wait times that far exceeded any reasonable expectation. I understand that popular attractions will naturally attract larger crowds, but the sheer lack of organization and inefficiency at Universal Studios was astounding. As a paying customer, I expected a more seamless experience. I had eagerly anticipated immersing myself in the magical world of Universal Studios, but instead, I spent most of my time standing in line, growing increasingly disillusioned by the minute. I sincerely hope that Universal Studios addresses this significant issue and takes steps to improve their crowd management system. The park's reputation and the satisfaction of its visitors are at stake. Until then, I cannot recommend Universal Studios to anyone seeking a hassle-free and enjoyable theme park experience. In conclusion, my visit to Universal Studios was marred by interminable queues, overcrowding, and a lack of organization. The park failed to deliver on its promise of a thrilling and magical adventure, leaving me and my family with a sense of regret and frustration. Unless significant improvements are made, I would caution others against wasting their time and money at Universal Studios.",

Picked up express single use passes in morning and there was surge pricing at 90 a ticket. (Was 70 a few days earlier). Went on about 7 rides, and altho we did manage to save a lot of time in queues, wasn't sure is it's worth that kind of premium. I think maybe 50 is more reasonable for the single use express and maybe double that foe the unlimited as I don't see how they police it from being shared around groups of friends. Didn't see a single character all day. And it bucketed down in rain 3 times for extended periods. We got soaking wet. Even after buying an umbrella there. There is some cute merchandise at the shops. The meals we had there is at least double the cost of normal restaurants outside and not very tasty. Was it fun yes. But it is an expensive day out. It is also super hot. Well singapore is in general. Guess the rain was good for cooling it down. The metro line to get out of sentosa was super long as well if u leave around park close.",

The rides that stand out are the Transformers ride and the cylon rollercoaster. Don't get me wrong - most kids will still like this place but I felt like the experience could have been a tad bit better. The only reason I gave two stars was because i enjoyed doing the roller coasters again and again and one of them has a couple of inversions which stand out. The Transformers ride does have a thrilling feel to it. The mummy ride was nice but too short. In fact most rides just feel really short Overall the park is a small place. There aren't too many rides. A few are meant for the very young (3-6), but more could have been done to make them more exciting. For the price, I wish they had made better rides with more options. The food options are terrible. Mostly junk food like burgers and fries, which I guess is staple food for most children but I'd like to feed my children real food which is not loads of fat and salt. Very few options for vegetarians. The express pass is worth it. The crowds are just too much. If you like waiting in long queues, then don't buy the express pass but if that's too expensive, I'd say just don't come.",

It feels like a punishment to stand in the queues everywhere for such long periods of time to enjoy the attractions if one doesn't have an Express pass. Suggestion: Proper seating arrangements should definitely be made in the waiting areas. 2. Due to this, even if one has reached early at 11 am at the opening time, it will be impossible to cover everything on a hoiliday by 6 pm when the Studios closes. 3. Entry passes are fixed to a single date. Anything can go wrong with anyone anytime and it is fully likely that due to those circumstances, one cannot make it on that particular day when the tickets are purchased. Suggestion: Passes should be open for 6 months or atleast a month. Tourists can then go to enjoy the attractions at their convenience in that time frame. 4. Express passes are not available online. Also, the price of those passes is more than the entry pass cost. Overall, after our visit to The Universal Studios, we remember our legs aching by standing in long queues MUCH MORE than the fun we got from the rides and the shows. It seems fun comes at a huge punishment - that too after paying through our pockets. Highly disappointed. Hence, the 2 star rating.",

To deal with the insane wait times, they expect you to buy an Express pass which costs more than the ticket itself. -Prepare to wait upto 2 hours for each ride -If you get your ticket from Sentosa, youll have to wait in other line and redeem them before you get in -Food is rather expensive -The transformers ride was quite nice, and the Shrek show was good too.

As any amusement park, its busy, quite busy, even on weekdays, and the waiting lines can get long, but thats part of the amusement park experience. My one recommendation to anyone the wishes to go is to bring outside food, make your own or buy outside, the food there is very expensive for little portions and its not really good, tho a little desert is nice after a while. Bring water and snacks as well as both are over the market price, so its better to buy some beforehand at a 7-Eleven for example. A great place and a must if you have money to spend for the tickets, would def recommend.",

They did give us the option of waiting or leaving but we should have gotten an express pass to another ride imo Whole ticketing thing was stupid too. We bought tickets at the train station going to sentosa island. Got lined up at the gates, 1hr goes by and we're told these aren't tickets to enter, they're tickets to get entry tickets so we had to line up at a different place again for about 1hr. Frustrating to say the least. If you want to actually enjoy this place then an express pass is a must. It's actually funny that a taxi driver we had a couple of days later told us Sentosa Island sucks. He and all the other drivers had an acronym for Sentosa",

I was fine with the idea of spending a whole day at the park, but the queues for the rides were just unrealistic. 150 minutes for Cylon, 120 minutes for transformers, 100 minutes for revenge of the mummy and 60 minutes for both canopy flyer and rapids adventure. The express pass is an ABSOLUTE MUST to get anywhere near doing these rides in one day especially as the park is only open from 11-6. Food was good which was a plus point although drinks were on the tad expensive, generally a very expensive resort which I felt was not value for money.",

The park offers a wide array of attractions that cater to various tastes and age groups. One standout attraction was the phenomenal Transformer ride, an absolute must-try for any visitor. The attention to detail and immersive experience truly brought the Transformers world to life. On the positive side, the park's themed zones were brilliantly designed, immersing visitors in different universes, from Hollywood to Sci-Fi City. The entertainment shows and live performances were engaging, adding to the overall festive atmosphere. Additionally, the convenience of booking tickets online and utilizing the express counter significantly reduced waiting times, ensuring more time to enjoy the attractions. However, the only downside was the occasional long queues, which is quite common for popular attractions. To make the most of your visit, I highly recommend booking tickets online in advance and opting for the express counter to bypass long queues. This allows you to maximize your time and enjoy a seamless experience at Universal Studios. Overall, a thrilling adventure that's perfect for fans of movies and theme park enthusiasts alike!",

When our turn came, they announced that due to technical reasons the ride is postponed, you may wait in queue or leave the queue voluntarily. After 20 min we have to leave as dont want to miss other rides. We paid for locker also. We asked the security person that since we already waited for 40 min, please allow us from express entry next time. When we came back the security person changed and he hasnt allowed and said since you voluntarily left, you have come from normal queue which is again 40 minutes long. We tried explaining that it was not our fault as your ride went in to technical problem also that we are with kids and cant go for 40 min again standing, but they didnt listened. He asked to check with guest service which is 20 min from here at the entrance. Frustrated but I went there, the lady was kind and gave me 4 express pass, but now I already waisted 40 min. Any ways, I did the ride of 5 min and waisted 80 minutes. Almost similar story with all other rides. I strongly recommend to not to go to Universal studio as its total waste. You will waist your money as well as time. Mummy rides we cant do as there were hight restrictions for our kids and even though I got express pass, few rides are not allowing express entry. They close all rides at 4:30 even though the timing is 5PM.",

As such, they had changed It's timing to 10am - 5 pm so that it could sell separate tickets for Halloween of the same park from 6 pm. There are only about 15 rides including children's rides as such queue for each ride was huge. The average waiting time for each ride was nearly 60 minutes for general tickets (costing about 5,000/- INR) and 20 minutes for express pass (about 10k INR). The ride time was between 40 seconds to 2 minutes max. So we had to wait for an hour for a minute long ride. By 5:30 pm the staff started forcing people who didn't have Halloween tickets out of the park. Their entire focus was only on money unlike rest of singapore. Would never visit again.",

Although the theme park isn't very large, some of the rides and performances were truly spectacular, leaving me wanting more. The most impressive experience was the Waterworld show, with its captivating atmosphere and remarkable sound effects. Of course, the 4D movies were also quite exciting. However, the only downside was the disappointing attitude of some of the park's staff. In a place filled with joy and laughter, it was strange to encounter staff members who appeared expressionless, lacking any smiles, and maintaining a stern demeanor. In fact, the behavior of some of the employees made visitors feel uncomfortable, which was truly regrettable.",

The decorations are magnificent and impressive, particularly the Egyptian part... The attractions offered are relatively calm except for the two flagship thrill attractions... which also see their queues very long... The attractions present are new, not seen in any case at DisneyLand Paris. 3 stars because despite this environment, there are many negative points. Firstly, the opening hours of the park, it only opens at 10 a.m. and closes very early (6 p.m.)... when you want to enjoy the two most popular attractions, you have to wait 1h30 on average... which means that there is little time left to explore the park when you spend 3 hours waiting for two attractions. As a result, this makes the cost of entry quite significant: 82 Singapore dollars for an adult... you have the option of taking a VIP PASS, allowing you not to have to queue for the attractions, price per person in addition to the ticket: 80 dollars... help!!! Finally, the last black point, the lockers. The attractions cannot be taken with your bags and personal belongings, mobile phones are also prohibited in the attractions and in queues, so very few souvenirs... Lockers are then positioned for each of the attractions for a maximum period of use and then paying for it... which means that it is almost impossible not to have to reach into your wallet if you want to do the main attractions.",

I would assume the staff being Singaporean would have been be better educated. it really shames me being a Singaporean. what happens to \"Excuse me Sir/Mdm\"? the 1 ride that really piss me, was at Sesame street, apparently there's a booster seat on 1 of the back row seat of the cart, i try to remove it, unaware that i wasn't suppose to do so . no staff usher me to the cart nor advised me not to do so. then 1 of the attending staff, tall, lanky and bespectacled , actually told me off in a stern and rude manner\" don't remove it!, don't touch that, move to the front row\". i'm old enough to be his dad, where's the basic courtesy? Management of Universal Studio, you seriously have to relook at the coaching of the staff. On a general note, I observed that 70% of the staff displayed poor customer service. They portrayed a aura of being disgruntled and have no sense of belonging to Universal Studio. I feel really bad as a Singaporean as this isn't the Singapore experience that I would like our foreign visitors to witness. Genting RWS, I understand that you are expanding but before that, pehaps relook to the education of the staff and more walking of the gound by management. 2 stars for the remaining staff which didn't makes it a total disappointment for my family and me.",

The themes and activities were very well planned, and as parents, my partner I were impressed with everything there was to see and do for us and our 3-year-old. However, the relentless humidity and heat made waiting in the long queues quite unpleasant. On a positive note, the staff were excellent and very helpful; we didn't encounter any unhelpful staff throughout the park. Our biggest disappointment came when we tried to grab some food. Unfortunately, all the food outlets had a technical issue and couldn't accept card payments. We didn't have any cash on hand, and without food, both our toddler and we couldn't fully enjoy all the rides and attractions. It's disheartening to know that a massive establishment like Universal Studios couldn't resolve a technical issue or organize an alternative for its visitors. At this point, I'm not sure if we'll be returning. It's frustrating that such an issue could significantly impact our experience. I hope that Universal Studios Singapore takes steps to address these kinds of technical glitches in the future to provide a more seamless and enjoyable experience for its visitors.",

A big chunk of the park is currently closed as they're converting the area to Minionland. My family loves the Minions and is really looking forward to seeing it when I opens. Most of the park is well maintained, but some of it looks a little run down....especially the Shrek area (Far Far Away). There are a few really good rides here. I especially like the Revenge of the Mummy and the Human/Cylon rollercoasters. You need to empty your pockets for those rides and there are nearby lockers that are free for 90 minutes. Overall, I like Universal Studios Singapore, but mostly go here because of a lack of options in the area. This park is nicer than Legoland Malaysia, but also quite a bit more expensive. Our annual passes for Legoland expired recently, but at some point we're going to sign up again and probably won't visit Universal Studios until those passes expire again. Hopefully Minionland will be open by our next visit.",

The wait time for popular attractions were up to 30-45 minutes during peak hours of the day (12-3pm). The crowds got less towards late afternoon, and there was almost no wait time at all for most attractions after 4pm. Most of the attractions (expect for kids ones) were very exciting!! Make sure you have a strong/fearless heart!! HAHAHA Everything was fantastic, but the weather - Its HOT!! Like seriously, that wasnt a very nice experience for me, and the sun ,could be overwhelming during a sunny day.

Total negligence with whoever was in line... When leaving I thought about buying the fast-pass, when I went to buy it it started raining, and the park was closed for a whole 3 hours, no rides were working anymore. After 1 hour with nothing to do, a waterworld show was about to start and we decided to watch it, to our surprise, right at the beginning of the show, an employee had an accident and the show was canceled and they told us to leave the place... As if that wasn't enough, I went to try to buy an ice cream, I was the first in line, and I only went close to the counter to the side to look at the flavors, to get started and the attendant was super rude to me saying that I was missing the line, I I tried to explain what happened to him, he didn't even want to listen to me, super ignorant.

To add to it all, the customer service is horrible. First your staff was rude to us, and dared to use the excuse that this is how Singaporeans talk.

I would recommend everyone to get the tickets via their website as it offers 1 hour early access. The park offers a thrilling array of rides and attractions, creating a captivating atmosphere for visitors. However, my excitement took an unexpected turn when we got stuck on one of the rides (the Transformers). The staff kept us updated and we were given an express pass as compensation. This hiccup slightly dampened the experience, highlighting a need for better maintenance and operational efficiency. Another ride went again into maintenance after we reached the front of the queue after waiting half n hour, another disappointment (The chase of the mummy) On the culinary front, the variety of food options was commendable, but I couldn't ignore the steep prices. The expensive food choices were a drawback, making it less budget-friendly for visitors. It would be beneficial for the park management to reconsider pricing strategies to enhance the overall value for guests. Additionally, while most staff members were helpful, I encountered instances where a bit more politeness could have made a difference. Improving staff interactions would undoubtedly contribute to a more positive and memorable visitor experience. In conclusion, Universal Studios Singapore offers a fantastic time with its attractions, but addressing issues like ride maintenance, food pricing, and staff politeness would elevate the overall guest satisfaction.",

Felt like they were slowing down operations to sell more Express Passes. Service is very slow in restaurants as well, and most photo stands for the attractions were not working. Theres also no nighttime show, neither a lot of street entertainment. The major show in the park - Waterworld - happens once a day only.

With such a hefty entrance fee, this was the most expensive wait and the biggest disappointment we have ever experienced. What I found particularly bad was that there was no indication of waiting times in the morning hours. Only when we left the studios in the afternoon, deeply disappointed and pissed off, did we see waiting times (45-80 minutes). I also have to mention that you can and probably should buy express entry (extra entry with shortened waiting times) for 100 SGD per person if you want to experience anything at all in this park and dont want to spend almost the entire time of your stay waiting. Two people 246 SGD for Cable Car and Universal Studios entrance 200 SGD Express 446 SGD Too Much!!!",

I was there on a Wednesday but there were so few people there that I oftentimes could walk right to the coaster and get in without waiting. However, the park is very small when compared to the other Universal Studios and therefore the ticket price feels a bit expensive. There are 3 rollercoaster that are fast paced, namely the two battlestar galactica and the return of the mummy coaster. Besides that there are multiple shows and smaller things like rafting. Also lots of character meets which I would highly recommend doing because there were usually just a crowd. At the character meets there is staff that will take a picture with your smartphone for you.",

I think that is very unprofessional and intentional. Ticket prices increased despite having an entire section closed for renovations is one thing, but closing off one of the most popular rides there without prominent notices especially on platforms where people would get their tickets from is really too much. I doubt a big organisation like RWS will have such an incompetent marketing team so higher possibility that this is the management's decision to intentionally withhold important information like this so as to not affect their profits. Dishonest business calls for a CASE report. And a staple theme park snack: turkey leg, is not available at USS. Used to be available across multiple food stands within USS but seems like it has been reduced to only one but don't bother because it's out of stock for god knows how long. They've also replaced some of the classic theme park foods to more \"localised\" food from other countries. Vadai was available at possibly every food stand there is. Every restaurant has a menu item with some form of Indian cuisine fused in them. Not what youd expect from a theme park. Been here a few times, this might be my last visit. The standards of RWS and USS has dropped so much I wonder why tourists still visit. Utterly disappointed. The only good thing I have to point out is the staffs. Good service but horribly managed. The park facilities seem badly maintained. If youve been on the Cylon ride youll get what Im talking about. Same for all the other rides, seat belts, harness, the whole place needs some deep cleaning. Gross.",

There is no or less seating across the area or even for attractions with long distance making it worst and painful 3. Most of the staff are rude with you esp if you belong to different community or are a tourist and not a localite. They shout at u for no reason. 4. The parade is only done on Sundays and most characters are not available on weekdays. We met the puss cat who was equally rude with us in behavior. Why even act like a character if u cnt handle your role humbly? 5. After the entire days hectic walk when we left, the train que was again huge, trains run v v slow with bad cooling and suffocates you as it's so packed. Taxi stop is v far so making it difficult. As usual no place to sit so u have to kill yourself. 6. It was so tiring that my 5yrs old slept and we had to carry her in our arms waiting in this exit que to get the express train. The escalators to climb up to board the train were not functional so we had to take huge staircase with her and our bags with other child. There was no priority given to us despite having a child in arms. All in all, worst experience for huge amount with no facilities to make you comfortable as a guest. They only need your money to make business but give a damn to you or your comfort.",

Feels like weve wasted a precious day from our trip to Singapore on being hot tired sweaty frustrated and hugely out of pocket. Even though we went early and on a Monday there were such long lines, far longer than the stated time, the ride operators were so slow at each round of the ride they fill it up with like 70% of the people with fast track tickets so felt really unfair. The fast track ticket was nearly as expensive as the main ticket and you have to buy it at the same time as the main ticket. We had a one year old baby and it was very frustrating to just have to carry him in a 40 minute plus queue, we ended up leaving most queues. Even the free shows, you have to get to them in advance otherwise you just miss them and have to wait another two hours for the next show. The meet and greet was so boring, unlike other theme parks where you can interact with the characters, here they just stand behind a rope and people queue up in the heat to take a quick photo and leave. The food again was also majorly disappointing, the cheapest thing you could get was water for 4 and soda for 5 everything else is double restaurant price too and not many great options, mainly just junk food and only 3 are halal. On a positive note the decor in the park was really nice but unfortunately just nothing interactive that you can enjoy without having to queue up for. At the very least they should make all queuing areas air conditioned and properly shaded, not just some far away fans and plastic canopy. There arent even benches to just sit outside to have a rest people just sit in the pavement or have to sit in a restaurant and pay for food. Just overall really not worth the price, came home so deflated unfortunately and wanting a refund as we did not enjoy it. I wouldnt recommend or return - particularly to people with young families.",

For sure to visit the transformers, the galaxy roller , the 3D move of Shrek (far far away castle) The food is expensive (as expected). So, you avoid to have a full lunch, and prefer to have a byte.

There was no checking of our bags. ENVIRONMENT: The roads are spacious and full of greenery. The shops and rides look new and clean, and the decor is adorable. Most rides have canopies/coverage with plentiful fans when lining up. RIDES: One land was closed for renovation when I went, so there were 12 rides and 8 shows in the park. My personal favourites are: - Mummy Ride: A roller coaster with a great balance between storyline, atmosphere and simply a good rollercoaster. - Shrek 4D Adventure: A 4D movie whose storyline happens after the SHREK 1 movie. The aircon and chairs are very comfortable and great for relaxing after walking around in the heat. - MELS: A 3-person performance of the greatest pop hits in history. A small scale show on the streets but very fun and energetic. FOOD: There are 8 restaurants and some food carts scattered around the park. Most sell fast food, noodles and some local dishes. Snacks and drinks cost around 8-10 SDG, AND dishes cost around 15-20 SDG. MY OPINION: A fun park with great theming. Its kept clean and safe, and I especially appreciate the enthusiastic attitudes of the staff working there. However, it is a relatively small park (we went on 90% of the rides in one day on a Friday). I think adding more large-scale dance performances would make it more fun.",

Afterwards i went to Battlestar Galactica. i was already waiting my turn at the gate but everyone was suddenly asked to return to the queue. As all of us were waiting, there wasnt any information or explanation given. We waited for a good 10-15 mins before an announcement was made that there were technical difficulties and the rides are delayed. Waited for 10 mins and no updates were given how long. Slowly everyone started leaving. A man asked the staff what is happening and the staff only said we have technical difficulties and unfortunately we dont exactly know what is causing it. You can stay but we dont know how long it will take or you can leave. I waited for about 15 mins and they still said they did not know what the issue was. There wont be much they would do for service recovery either. So i feel like the early entry ticket was wasted or useless as i didnt get to ride at all afterwards. The ride was only working about 30 mins after i left which is about the same time that more crowds were forming. When i wanted to ride, the wait time was more than 2 hours. Not only did i not get to ride it, when i waited for the transformer photo taking, it also delayed for 10-15 mins. Now i understand as it might be difficult to wear the costume but it was kinda frustrating as the queue was under the hot sun. We were not allowed to wait under the shelter either as it is considered to be entering the staffs zone. USS used to be fun and enjoyable, now just seems to be full of delays and issues without any service recovery. If you were to complain, they wont do anything much either and probably wont do anything when i write this review too. So just take note of this if you plan on going USS.",

                  "review_text": "We went there and bought the general admission ticket for 8085 per person. Then, when we went inside, it was overcrowded. When we went for a ride, it was a 100-minute waityes, over 1 hour just for 1 ride out of 16 attractions. So, to overcome this, the park offers you an express ticket for 100 per person. The ticket counter will sell you a ticket, but most of the attractions are not suitable for kids under 122 cm. So it was a waste of money for us. Altogether, we spent 600 plus 100 for the cable car. By spending 100 on express tickets you will feel like VIP (Very Important Person) as normal crowd is waiting for hours an hours while you can come in and out very quickly. I should have left my feeling at home in Australia that everyone is equal as the park doesn't treat you like that. My question is when they can accommodate large express ticket crowd why not others or make 1 price ticket and only let limited crowd in and out like in Night Safari where you have to pre book. Or else increase the staff or attractions facility. Surely if the business is making money then investing in impoverment won't be a issue. It lacks simple management solutions even though it Universal Studios. The park is overcrowded with Indians tourist mainly. Please mind I am an Indian Australian too. Not against any race, but the park staff was not able to control the crowd. My family and I were pushed 3-4 times while waiting for the attractions. I was elbowed twice. My wife and kid was pushed back by a man so he could break the queue and come to the front of the queue. Also, by the way, most of the time, no one was following the queue. The park will keep selling tickets to make more money; it's like quantity but not quality. I would not recommend it to families with young children or infants and toddlers as it's a waste of time and money. It will probably be okay with children over 6 -7 years plus, not for 3-4 years or below. If you have never being to Universal Studios then go for it. After the experience from Universal Studios we decided to cancel all other plan to water world and rest of the sentosa as I rather have relax holiday in the hotel pool relax and enjoy with kids rather then get pushed around, elbowed or rush around. Probably I would choose Thailand as it got everything to offer to everyone and the management on venue's is way better.",

The rides were fantastic, with my favorites being the Transformers ride, Battlestar Galactica, and The Mummy. These rides were thrilling and well worth the visit. However, I encountered a significant issue with the line management. There were often no staff present to guide the lines or monitor the crowd, which led to many people cutting in line. A specific group (and race) was particularly disrespectful, blatantly cutting lines and even applauding themselves for doing so. They were in large groups, which made the situation even more frustrating and disrupted the overall experience. Additionally, in such a closed environment, the lack of proper ventilation became quite apparent, making it uncomfortable with the poor smell lingering around. Sadly, the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure was closed during my visit, which was disappointing as I was looking forward to it. Despite these issues, I would still recommend visiting Universal Studios Singapore. The rides and attractions are top-notch, but I would advise against going on weekends to avoid the large crowds. Also, be vigilant for line cutters to ensure a more enjoyable experience.",

My only gripe is that as I type this it is 12pm and I have gone on every single ride apart from 2 kid friendly ones - so 12 rides in 3 hours - on a Sunday! Wouldnt recommend the express pass as it is not worth it if you arrive early. We are going home as basically done everything, granted there are a couple of shows which we could watch but not for over an hour. They are building a new Minions area so perhaps there is less than there would normally be, but for 50 I feel like there should be at least a whole days worth of activities, not a half day.

Reached at around 10 am ,took 80 min for the transformers ride,no place to sit while we wait,no option of rest rooms too. Next got on line for the roller coaster,the most sought after ride,after waiting for 2 hours and reaching just about the line where we enter the ride there was a technical issue and the ride was delayed,very unprofessional behaviour by the staff,no information was been shared ,they spoke very rudely and they sure do have a sense of superiority in them and for sure they are not service oriented,any which ways went around the whole park waiting for hours for very average rides,paying a bomb of food and water(almost 4times). Got back to the roller coaster,waited another 90min and still could not ride due to the same technical issue.same pathetic behaviour by the staff. Not bothered about their clients. Worst day of my life. Guys don't come here . These studio staff guys are only licking the soles of people who buy the super expensive express passes. Not bothered about the comment people who have also paid quite a lot for the regular ticket. Overhyped and over priced and pathetic services Avoid And if you must go always but that expensive express pass, never the regular tickets.",

Also not to forget Transformers. It has a single pass entry to the entire park and enjoy unlimited rides. If you want VIP entry to each ride and not to wait in the long queue then you buy an Express pass by paying an additional SGD100 per person. Generally the park has a max crowd between 12pm to 5pm. Post 5pm, you will have very less rush and the waiting at each ride would be 10-15mins. There are multiple performances as well in the Evening to relax. Also there are good shops for kids like Hershey's, Lego, Candylicious etc. Overall 5 star from my side for excellent crowd management, neat and clean and very well maintained amusement park",

The line to any attractions is quite long though, so if you want to save some times, you can buy the Universal Express Pass. The attractions, went through almost every one of them and enjoy it so much. The staffs are also very courteous, saw a few people trying to cut the line but the staffs handled it very professionally so kudos to them.

Just work around wait times as the park gets super quiet around 6pm, so we queued 5 mins for a lot of the rides later in the day, stay till later! Met shrek, Fiona, puss in boots and kitty long paws. And we met Optimus prime! The show they had on in the waterland was amazing too. Really good theming. Great experience, deffo recommend!",

There are so many exhilarating rides to go on and even if you dont like high speed intense rollercoasters (if you do go to 1. Cylon/Human, 2. Mummy), there are many chill relaxing rides and everywhere is a great place to take photos and create memories. There are also live performances / meet&greets with some fictional characters. There are many places to eat and rest (snacks or lunch/dinner) throughout the amusement park. This will be needed as it can get pretty hot However, the only downside is that most of the time when youre visiting (weekends/public holidays), you will HAVE to wait in a long line (20-60 minutes) for a single ride with the normal tickets. As a regular visitor here, I recommend purchasing the Universal Express Pass (S193) for optimal enjoyment and minimal wait time (you can go 8-10 times on a ride while people still wait in a line). I also recommend going on a less busy day like the weekdays and making full use of the entry time at 11:00am and exit at 6:00pm,",

We waited for more than 30 minutes per ride on average, with one ride (Jurassic Park) that exceeded an hour of wait. The roller coasters were 40 mins more on average, it was truly a horrible experience. In the shrek theater, one woman yelled at all of us for trying to enter when she opened the door with no clear instructions with what we should do. One person who was in charge of the bumblebee ride (turning cups) was incredibly rude to an Indian woman as he wrongly miscalculated the number of tickets that was given to him. The overall experience was terrible and avoid this amusement park at all costs. If it wasnt for the google system, Id give this place a -100 stars for being overcrowded, bad service attitude, and horrible ride experiences. This park is not worth visiting and should reflect on their operation and service. They should also consider making the fast pass actually fast as opposed to us throwing worthless money into a pass that made us wait for 60 mins with the worst service possible.",

We were waiting outside the established control line when an employee asked us to move in a different direction, so we moved to the location she requested. An employee wearing a nametag named Hafiz came back angrily and asked me to go somewhere else. I didn't think it was my fault because I followed the location requested by the staff when I initially requested a move. And since I followed the staff's instructions and stayed outside the clearly established control line, if my location was an issue, the control line was wrong or it was the staff's fault who asked me to move first, not mine. So, if necessary, I think it is something to kindly explain and provide guidance to, and not something to get angry at and throw a tantrum at my 8-year-old child and me. I hope your company reflects on whether holding an event that makes visitors angry is in line with your vision and mission statement. Thanks to Hafiz, my child and I were in a very good mood after coming here to freshen up. Thank you for giving me the worst experience(?)",

                  "review_text": "Having been to Florida a few times I was excited to visit Universal Singapore however that initial excitement quickly disappeared when I saw the queue for the first ride Cyclon (battlestar galactic rollercoaster) which was 90 minutes. First off they are militant about not having your phone or any bag on you and check prior to entering the queue meaning you can't even try and plan your day whilst waiting. And also basically no ride set up and amusement when waiting in line makes for a rather long and boring wait. Even the 1st class citizens who pay more than the price of the park ticket again to get the 'priority pass' had to wait about 30 minutes for the ride. Absolutely detest this scummy system parks seem to use but it seems to be standard and not normally too much of an issue if regular queue times are reasonable and rides have single rides options (of which I only seen this option for the transformer 4d coaster at Singapore universal) Eventually we managed to get on the coaster and it was pretty mid, the hulk or velocicoaster from Florida this is not. Anyway this set the scene for the rest of the day. Huge lines for pretty much all rides / shows and pretty average when you actually got to experience it. Also this was a Monday so I don't know if that makes a difference but I wouldn't want to see this park on a busy weekend. The water world show was ok. Probably the best thing there... And actually managed to see it without a massive wait which was a bonus. Overall I would avoid this park, it would make for an ok day out if they let about half of the people in on a daily basis but that would not line their coffers I guess....",

We purposely went on a weekday as weekends are very crowded. I was surprised to see the kind of rush here. The entry time for normal ticket was 10AM but I myself entered around 9.45AM as the gates were open. It was mind boggling to see that they have just provided tickets without any sense of whats happening inside. Sadly, the wait time for every ride for a Normal Ticket was 120 mins, even the people who had taken VIP tickets which has line free access to swings were waiting 35-45 mins for their turn. It was a low-key experience to see such kind of management at a place like this. Overall my experience was pretty bad just because of the Ticket price & kind of wait time they had given for every ride that just lasted fraction of seconds. They should really improve the management to understand headcount vs wait time/ride.",

The cleanliness of the park deserves special mention, as it significantly enhances the experience for visitors of all ages. The variety of rides caters well to both kids and adults, ensuring that every family member has something to enjoy. However, the waiting times for attractions are generally acceptable, though peak times can see longer waits, which is typical for a popular theme park. One area for improvement would be the addition of more resting areas, particularly for the elderly and young children. Incorporating more shaded or indoor rest spots could make the park even more accommodating for all age groups, reinforcing its status as a family-friendly destination.",

Although the Express ticket is a bit pricier, I highly recommend it for a smoother experience. Make sure to try all the ridestheyre fun and thrilling! The park operates from 10 AM to 5 PM, so plan your time accordingly. There are also themed events like Halloween and Minions that add extra entertainment throughout your visit",

They hide this term and condition because u wouldn't buy it if they made it clear in the terms and conditions. We were there on a busy wet day most of the rides close if raining so steer clear of rainy days there's not much to do.

Unfortunately, I booked our tickets through a sponsored link on Headout, unaware of the complexities involved. The ticketing process was confusing; in the past, there used to be one entrance ticket for the whole day entry, but now there are separate day and night passes. Misled by Headout's website, we unknowingly purchased day passes instead of night passes, spending 366 with express passes included for 2 persons only. When we arrived at the entrance, we hoped the staff would be understanding and allow us to switch to night passes with a willingness to pay the difference. However, we were denied entry with no flexibility shown. It felt unnecessarily harsh, especially since we had already paid for entry and the company had profited from it. The refusal to accommodate or show empathy was deeply disappointing. We were told to buy new tickets if we wanted to enterwe were reluctant to spend a total of 600-800 for just a few hours at a small and overcrowded theme park. In the end, we left and spent the money at VivoCity on some nice shoes instead. This experience taught us a hard lesson, spending 366 to return home upon arrival was really an upsetting experience and we doubt we will be returning to USS anytime soon.",

Please don't bring young kids onto rollercoaster rides like transformers or mummy they keep crying summore its a literal drop rollercoaster. I recommend kt grill and goldilocks for food. Some ride need to pay for locker, pls use locker or else mafan need to put belongings somewhere when on a ride. 1. Revenge of the mummy. The queues are long. My entire family was flabbergasted and almost vomited. Vigorous spinning, dropping and speeding up. Do not recommend for young kids and weak people, older kids maybe can lah based on if they are ok with it 2. Transformers 4d movie. It was also rollercoaster with spinning and speeding up, its kinda nice but queue is long 3. Seasame street spaghetti space chase. Great for seniors and younger children but no thrill at all it's so slow 4. Raptor rapids. My favourite ride so far. Guy at entrance was funny. The ride itself was exciting and there was a drop at the end. Others clothes were all soaked but only my converse was drenched. I thought the trex would spray water at us 5. Trolls hug time jubilee. Relaxing and fun for young families with bubbles and confetti. 6. Waterworld show. It was quite funny and exciting but not rlly for young kids becoz got gunfire, fireworks, fire and explosions. Don't sit at blue seats because you WILL get wet. The show itself 20 minutes long.",

The rides were good because there were little to none waiting times, but they closed early today because of a bit of rain, so be wary of that because then it won't be worth it otherwise.

They should give visitors, at least the 1st 20 or so in the queue a food or express voucher. 2nd ride, the same thing happened AGAIN. This time, my group were supposed to be the next batch but there were technical difficulties too. While we were thankful that we weren't left hanging in the air like the batch before us, it was definitely very unpleasant. Again, there was no initiative for service recovery at all! I had to request for express tickets while explaining my situation of having about 2 hrs wasted in between these 2 rides. It's difficult to get the staff attention too. They avoided eye contact, walked away from me. They ALL were deemed bz 'helping' with the situation. Even though 1 or 2 was just looking 'bz'. An art which was frustrating to witness. There was another ride that was slightly delayed with technical issues again, but thankful, it was simply just a short 10min delay. Surprisingly, it wasn't crowded on a CNY Sunday afternoon. Not much tourists. I guessed for local visitors, not many will visit again if they have the same experience like me. Don't think I will visit for the next 5 years.",

The roller coasters are poorly organized, the route is ridiculous and, with the exception of one, simply not worth the time. Maybe I'm just not the target group. The entire park organization is also deficient in many areas. On a rainy day, the air conditioning runs so cold that it becomes uncomfortable to go indoors in wet clothes. The milkshakes are so cold that you're more likely to chew ice crystals. In terms of price/performance: The food is simply not worth the money. Especially for Singapore conditions. This was the worst meal of my entire trip so far. So, onto the good things: The decoration is really well done. The facades in the streets are lovingly and detailed. The best ride in my opinion was Revenge of the Mummy. Good storytelling. I can completely advise against Puss in Boots. This is an absolute stop and go ride with no flow. The park has real potential that it is wasting in so many places, so it's a real shame. I'm leaving again after about 3 hours. I was really looking, I was really looking forward to the park but all in all it's more of a 3 classic park with a name",

Unfortunately, a disappointing incident at the Puss in Boots show at 4:25 PM ruined our day. After watching the show, my daughter, who loves Puss in Boots, was excited to take a photo with the characters. She patiently stood in line, but when it was nearly her turn, a couple skipped ahead of her. As she approached the stage, a staff member unfairly stopped her, claiming she wasnt in the queue, despite her waiting the whole time. He didnt let us explain, acted rudely, and even prevented her from rejoining the queue, saying the photo session was over. This upset my daughter deeply, and it hurt us to see her first Universal Studios experience end with such a bad memory. We feel very disappointed by this rude behavior and hope appropriate action is taken to prevent such incidents in the future.

The park was overcrowded, and the overall experience felt underwhelming. There was nothing particularly special about it, and it lacked the magic and excitement we expected from a major theme park. To make things worse, the park closes around 7 PM, with no night shows or special eventsjust a dull and abrupt ending to the day. The heat was also unbearable, reaching at least 40C, and there was no air conditioning in indoor areas. Instead of offering a break from the extreme temperatures, the enclosed spaces felt suffocating. Navigating through the packed crowds in these conditions made the visit exhausting rather than enjoyable. Compared to Disneylandwhich weve visited three times and loved every timeUSS doesnt even come close. The lack of proper facilities, entertainment, and overall mediocre experience make it completely overrated and not worth the visit.",

You stand in line for 40-60 minutes, 1.5-2 minutes of pleasure. Yes, and this pleasure is dubious. For adults, the attractions are very simple, but for families with children it will be torture - try standing for 40 minutes at each attraction with your child. It's complicated. We stood for 40 minutes on one attraction, and it closed right in front of us! For inexplicable reasons. The other attraction had almost the same thing, but they still opened it. Overall the impression is very bad, especially for the money. The food is tasteless, everything is not budget, the attractions are boring and not extreme (except for one). Terrible, don't recommend!",

Rifdi from Super Hungry food stand was incredible, he was so accommodating to our needs despite it being crowded during lunch time.

                  "review_text": "Universal Studios Singapore has some truly enjoyable attractions, and I did have fun thanks to the Express Pass I purchased. But its difficult to overlook the lack of organization and indifference shown by staff during our visit, especially at the very start of the day. Upon arriving at the park entrance, I witnessed a frustrating incident in the Express lane: a few individuals were standing in line without tickets, claiming their friends were buying them. Staff allowed them to hold a place, and soon after, a large groupmore than ten people cut the line to join them. Only a few individuals were initially holding the spot, and none of them had even purchased entry tickets when they started queuing. When the rest of the group arrived, a staff member briefly told them to go to the back of the line, but then stood by and allowed them to stay once they pushed their way in. To make matters worse, I was asked to move aside to make room for them, even though I had followed all the rules and had a valid Express Pass. The handling was unfair, inconsistent, and felt like the louder you were, the more you got away with. I later sent a formal complaint via email, only to receive a generic and dismissive response that read more like a script than a genuine reply. The tone was cold and impersonal, showing no willingness to acknowledge the staffs mishandling or take any meaningful responsibility. It felt less like an effort to resolve a guest concern, and more like a gesture to defend their staff while avoiding accountability. I want to be fair: I did enjoy many parts of the park and appreciated the efficiency of the Express system itself. But much of the experience was tainted by what felt like an unwelcoming, mechanical attitude among staff. Id estimate that at least 60% of the employees I encountered looked visibly unhappy or disengaged with their work. The park has potential to deliver a great experience, but they seriously need to address crowd control, staff morale, and basic guest fairness. Without the Express Pass, this wouldve been a very different and likely much more frustrating day.",

It felt like we were being blamed for their own lack of crowd control. To make things worse, one staff member even falsely accused me of removing the barrier myselfan extremely unfair and unacceptable allegation.

Let me begin with the reality this place is overhyped, overpriced, overcrowded, and completely mismanaged. 3 HOURS of standing in line for a single ride, and the same story repeated at every attraction. Queues are deliberately hidden behind walls and turns to deceive visitors. From the outside, they look short but once youre in, youre stuck in a never-ending maze. Most rides had huge wait times, and some were just CLOSED without any discounts in tickets or compensation. There are ZERO places to sit along the queues not a bench in sight. For families, kids, or elderly people, its pure torture. Staff were clueless, communication was nonexistent, and there was no system to manage the crowd. The place was in absolute chaos. We paid 208 SGD (12,800 INR) for entry (2 adults 1 child). Thinking Express Pass would help, we paid another 380 SGD (23,400 INR) for that. Total: 588 SGD (36,200 INR). And what did we get? Just 2 or 3 rides after hours of queuing, even with the Express Pass which turned out to be a complete SCAM. Express lines were also painfully slow and overcrowded. It was a joke. This is not entertainment its a money-sucking machine targeting tourists with big promises and delivering nothing but exhaustion and frustration. Universal Studios Singapore should be ashamed. This is fraud in the name of fun, and they have no business charging premium prices for such a pathetic, mismanaged experience. Strong warning: AVOID this place. There are far better ways to spend your money in Singapore. Dont fall for the hype like we did.",

I was one of the earliest people to get on too. -The ticket price was still full price even though some major attractions like Transformers: The Ride and Waterworld were closed. No discounts offered. -Waiting time not accurate. -Some rides, like Canopy Flyer, suddenly broke down and we had to wait ages for them to fix it. The staff didnt take the initiative to explain things. -The park closed early at 7PM. The lights had just turned on and everything looked so nice for photos, but we had to leave. No light show, water show, or fireworks either. -The Q system was ok la.. but there were no chairs. Standing for so long was exhausting! -The restaurant was too crowded and the food was just ok. Tips if Youre Planning to Go: -Get there before 8.30AM to avoid the crowds and long queues. -Bring your own water bottlethere are refill stations. -Check the Sentosa website for maintenance updates, opening hours and etc. -Hit the popular rides first, and then pick ones with shorter waiting time as you go. -Always check the weather forecast beforehand, even if its not 100% accurate. -Do some research and read reviews or other peoples experiences before buying tickets and planning your day. -Go on weekdays and avoid peak months and public holidays. Overall: This is my first theme park, but I think it might be average compared to others. Thankfully, I didnt run into any really serious problems like some others did. Despite the issues, I still managed to enjoy myself but i'm still sad that Transformers: The Ride was closed that day (i can't changed my fixed date ticket) y",

Instead, the park uses Universal licenses and has a mix of familiar and unfamiliar attractions based on Universal franchises. I mention this because the park looks very much like the other Universal Studios parks but feels a little cheaper. Even identical attractions had corners cut so the magic isn't quite the same. If you are familiar with the typical Universal experience, set your expectations accordingly. That said, the park is fun. Is it the best Universal Studios themed park? Not even close but that doesn't mean it is horrible. The most unique standout attraction is Battlestar Galactica. This is a pair of roller coasters, one a calmer sit down coaster and the other a thrilling inverted coaster, that intertwine with each other. It feels like a cross between Dueling Dragons and Incredible Hulk. I wouldn't prioritize Universal Studios Singapore as a top thing to do in Singapore but if you are looking for something to do, it is worth a visit.",

I recently visited Universal Studios Singapore for the first time, and overall, it was a fantastic experience filled with excitement, nostalgia, and adventure. As someone who has never been to a Universal Studios park before, I was genuinely impressed by the vibrant atmosphere, the immersive themes, and the sheer scale of the park. It truly brings your favorite movies and characters to life in a way that feels magical. Theming & Attractions: From the moment you step in, the level of detail in the parks design is jaw-dropping. Each zoneHollywood, New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, and Madagascaris beautifully themed and transports you into a completely different world. I particularly enjoyed the Revenge of the Mummy ride in Ancient Egypt and the Transformers 3D ride in Sci-Fi Cityboth were thrilling and well worth the hype! Shows & Entertainment: The live shows and street performances were also a pleasant surprise. The WaterWorld stunt show was incredibly well-executed, with amazing effects and high energy. There were also plenty of characters walking around for photos, which added to the experience. Food & Facilities: Food options were decent, with a variety of choices catering to different tastes, though a bit on the pricier side (as expected in theme parks). The park was clean, well-maintained, and had plenty of rest areas, shaded spots, and clean restrooms. Crowds & Waiting Times: This was the only downside to my visit. While I anticipated some waiting, I was a bit overwhelmed by the length of the queuesespecially for the popular rides. Even with a weekday visit, some lines were over an hour long, which really ate into the time we had to explore everything. I highly recommend arriving early and possibly investing in the Universal Express Pass if your budget allowsit makes a big difference. Staff & Service: The staff throughout the park were friendly, helpful, and very professional. They did a great job managing the crowds and keeping the lines moving as efficiently as possible. Final Thoughts: Universal Studios Singapore is absolutely worth a visit, especially if youre a fan of movie-themed attractions. Its a great mix of thrill rides, shows, and immersive environments that appeal to all ages. Just go in preparedwear comfortable shoes, stay hydrated, and if youre not a fan of long waits, consider the Express Pass. Despite the lines, the overall experience was memorable and fun, and I would definitely come back again!",

These are the most intense and definitely worth the detour! The park is very large, well decorated and super pleasant to visit. The atmosphere is immersive, the decorations are neat, and there is fun for all ages. From midday onwards, the queues start to fill up, so it's best to get the big hits first.

Highly recommended for parents living in Asia. Location: you can take MRT to Harbour Front station and then take Sentosa Gateway to Universal Studio gate (Google Map, as the time I wrote this review, is not really accurate for the route from downtown) Environment: all facilities are tailored to serve kids well so nothing to worry about Price: a ticket for an adult 76 SGD, a pack of popcorn 9 SGD, a cup of smoothie 6 SGD, not cheap but still ok during summer time. The ticket price is arbitrary depending on seasons. Service: Service and user experience are all impressive. The only problem is you need to line up for more than 1-2 hours for each attraction unless you buy Universal Express. Best practice for new comers( me have visited in California, Osaka and Singapore) 1. Sandals, shorts, and t-shirts are best dress code for enjoying universal studio. Singapore is hot in most of time so the dress code will help. (And sandals will keep your feet dry after playing Jurassic World boat) 2. Buy tickets online to save your time from hours line-up. For example, klook. 3. Go hot attractions first when getting in. They will take most of your time. Googling some suggestions from internet beforehand will help - my suggestion is Transformer - Jurassic World - Water World (fixed schedule) - and the rest. 4. During summer time, even weekdays are full of people. However, its still better than coming here in weekends. This place is awesome and sincerely hope everyone have a good time here!",

Word of advice is to avoid the weekends! Waiting time for rides can stretch out to more than an hour unless you squeeze that pocket to buy Express Passes to get into the express line which gets you onto the rides 50% faster! And bring some tanning lotion and a hat coz it can get pretty hot in the day. Much sought after rides would be Revenge of the Mummy, and the most exciting roller coaster rides, Human Cyclone and Battlestar Galactica which runs at a speed of 82km/h at a height of 40m.... Turns any stomach inside out. So have a light one before you take these monsters for a ride. Highly recommended to visit if you are a tourist.",

While I was waiting, a Universal employee invited me to the first family customer celebration event. As the first family customer that day, we started the gate opening with a comment from our family. It was a very special experience for the children as they received a free family photo and a ticket for three express rides as a gift. Because it was a weekday, there weren't many people, and you could experience most things you wanted after waiting for about 10 minutes. I don't really recommend the Universal restaurant. The more you go out, the better it is to eat out. It's cheaper and tastes better. Since it closed at 6 o'clock, I tried out most of the rides. Compared to the United States and Japan, there are not many people, so you can enjoy it much more leisurely.",

Make sure to pick map of universal studio as it will help you in finding rides. Lots of meal options are also available though prices are on higher side. But it is fun place. Enjoy",

However, many of the amusement facilities here have height restrictions, which is more suitable for children over 125 cm. The time of each show can also be arranged well, and every show can be participated. It is recommended that everyone check the map and the time of each show before coming. With some arrangement, you can have a lot of fun and the children will have a great time. Many facilities are not available in our country, Taiwan. The little ones will have a great and unforgettable memory!",

Starting early, as soon as the gates open is a good way to begin.The crowd at night is less though. A map of the park, is a necessity, to plan out your trip. The three best rides are the cylon, mummy and transformer rides, which attract the longest queues. Some of the rides need you to be empty handed and with empty pockets. Locker facilities are available at various point, in case you don't have someone waiting outside. During my last visit, frequent failures of rides occurred, some where people had to wait in the rides to be retrieved..... Probably a one off. Nothing new added over the years. Good for one visit, nothing to come back to except the cylon rides. Good idea to take an express pass to reduce the wait time in queues. The express passes are available at most shops within Universal studios, but a few attractions are excluded from the express pass. Photographs are available at each ride and cost about 20SGD a piece. The restaurants are crowded at meal times, so it's a good idea to eat a little early if you want to avoid a long wait to order and get seating. The small food and beverage stalls don't accept cards but only cash. It can get dehydrating during the day, especially in summer, so these are usually the stalls where you can top up. The parades are entertaining for young children and those young at heart, so you can time your rides and visit based on the parade timings.",

Off-peak season is during Monday to Thursday while on-peak season is during Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Public Holidays and June and December. USS is definitely fun for the whole family and thrill-seekers. This theme park is built for all ages. The little kids will be fascinated and delighted to see alot of famous movie characters. They have alot of shows for kids and rides for them. Adults can try doing the roller coaster Battlestar Gallactica, indoor coaster Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park Ride on the boat and Transformer 3D Ride. Restrooms, coffeeshops, food shops and resort's staffs are everywhere. This is a must visit resort in Singapore. Come hurry and enjoy the show and ride. To top all of these, the resort is actually clean! That is what Singapore is known for right? Cleanliness. Entrance fee - 75SGD if you buy here at USS. But dont forget to check Klook for lower prices and discounts. When entering Sentosa, dont buy tickets first because you can use your EZ link card. Thats my mistake. So dont be like me. Haha. per Meal budgets should be 10Sgd above. Dont forget to bring coins. They also offer single ride options if you dont mind riding solo or separated from your group. This is actually works fine for me because the queue here is alot shorter than the regular or group one. If you dont want queueing for an hour or two, you can check express tickets online, maybe 60Sgd. Im not sure about this but you can check online.",

I would like to discourage you from purchasing an express ticket here. Basically, I don't know much about Transformers and its name, but if you ride a roller coaster and then ride a Mummy, I think most adults will enjoy it. If you are traveling with children, there are quite a few rides that children will enjoy, so I think it is not a bad idea to purchase an express ticket only if you are traveling with children. If you have belongings or bags, you can leave them in the lockers for the roller coaster and Mummy and use the attractions. It is free for about 2 hours at a time and you have to pay after that, so if you are visiting with a group of people, you can keep using the lockers for free if you take turns using them, so make good use of them. Uniquely, in the case of Singapore Universal, you can only leave and re-enter once, so if you need to eat, we recommend going out to Vivo City, eating there, and then coming back. The food at Universal was truly terrible. It's not that wide, so even if you move around a lot, you can enjoy it in half a day. One thing that was disappointing was that there were a few times when we had to wait to ride the attractions, but many people from India would cut in line with people of all ages, so it was very frowned upon.",

Steven Spielbergs film Gallery is quite nice though. Outside food are strictly not allow. Do buy tickets in KLOOK website for cheaper tickets compare to their counter and to avoid queue. Recommend to take The Mummy ride around 7pm as there is only 15 minutes waiting compare to 3hours of waiting at 2pm which is crazy.",

The shows Sesame Street and Shrek are very nice. Don't miss them. I didn't know The Universal Studio can be so fun even for people my age. Plenty of food stores with different types of food to choose and eat. For souvenirs plenty to shop, see and buy Service staff are kind, patient, courteous and knowledgeable Easy to get there, with both public transportation and your own car. There's plenty of car parks Would recommend you visit the studio at least once if you can afford it with your family. It will be a memorable day and event that they will find hard to forget.",

Theres probably 3 rides worth a mention and thats the two roller coasters and the Transfomers ride. I guess smaller children would also like some of the themed children rides like Shrek and Jurassic Park. I suggest booking your tickets online as the ticket purchasing at site is pretty slow. We went both times early morning and in the evening. All the rides were working from 7pm onwards and surprisingly not as crowded compared to the morning openings. If youre finding Singapore a little boring as we did then give this place some consideration.",

There are a few rides and places you must visit. 1) Start with Madagascar. Everything here is suited for kids above 80cm. 2)Take the Crate adventure ride, it is a relaxing and fun ride to warm the kids up to the place. Next, hop on to King Julien's Beach Party go round with is a simple carousel ride that parents can accompany. Most stuff at Madagascar are weather proof so even if it rains, u can go for these. 3) Next, go forth to to visit Far Far away cos that is where shrek lives haha. Up the challenge by taking the kids on the Enchanted Airways. Kids need to be 92 cm to take this gentle (not really for some, our girl hated this ride) roller coaster ride. It is exciting and SHORT. Less than 2 mins and it is over. Some boys may love this. So worth a try. 4) Go watch shrek 4D adventure. long queue but moves fast and for the time you queue, u get to spend at least 15mins seated down in a cool and comfy environment. Whn you exit, u will end up at the Fair God Mother potion factory, there is a tiny ferris ride here which u can q for. Tons of stuff to buy and u can have food at friars cafe opposite. Do remember to check out timings for meet and greet. 5)Next visit The lost world. Not all rides are suited for your toddlers and preschoolers. Just queue for the Dino soaring another very gentle ride which all will love. 6)hop over to canopy flyer to up the excitement again. Minimum ht here is 92cm. 7)Shop at Jurassic store if your boy or man love dinosaurs. Ask for promotion. In Dec 2019, get 10 percent off when u pay with MasterCard. 8)End the day with a visit to Elmo at New York which is near to the entrance/exit. Plenty of areas for toilet breaks and you can rent prams if u need. Have fun!",

The only off-putting thing is it gets very crowded during the holidays and have lot of wait time.

After these have lunch at your favourite theme park restaurant . After these go for smaller rides in Jurassic world/ Madagascar and catch the Hollywood action packed sequence .

Because of the weather conditions you should definitely plan to get wet and soaked on the water attractions! We usually shifted frequently to these to get \" cooled down\". The stunt shows are worth to visit as well- if you liked the storyboard of waterworld :-) The experience with the team have been all positive - you really feel welcomed everywhere in the park!

He was here to celebrate his 4th birthday, (gotta abuse the free entry for children under the age of 4), and they were so friendly and accommodating to him. One of the staff told him to tell Optimus it was his birthday and we all got such a kick out of the interaction between the two of them. Thanks for making his special day out super special!

Apart from the rides, they have different zones of famous movie sets, Hollywood, New York, Madagascar etc. And like any other amusement park, there's so much to see and do so just one fun filled day is not gonna cut it.",

Now with the rule of twos I'd encourage you to get a ticket as no families will be there. Do get the Universal Express pass - best 40 you will spend, as you reduce your queue time from 30-60 sweaty minutes to about 60 seconds. You can buy these all over the park.

You get the feel of universal the moment you enter the arena. 360roller coaster was best one there closely followed by Egypt themed roller coaster ( not 360 though ). Not too many activities for kids below 3 feet though. If you have small kids, I suggest you rent a stroller available there with (15 to 30 sgd rent). Do take you hats and glasses and do not carry too much loose articles/items with you as many rides not allow you to carry them with you.",

Recommended rides ( From my experience) 1. Mummy (Animated roller coaster) 2. Jurassic park ( Canopy Flyer) 3. Transformer ( Soft and Simple yet fun) 4. Cylone and Human ( Hardest ones) Dont go for mummy safari its slow and mostly for toddlers There are many more but you need a lot of time, for maximum enjoyment visit during non rush season like January or April",

My 6yo at the time of writing, who was excited to try \"roller coasters\", told me that's scary enough. Worth buying the express tickets too especially if you arrive some time after it opens. Note there are rides that you can't use it on, so do check the USS website. When we went, the Canopy Flyer was one of them, but we got in at the start of the day so there was no queue. Photos with the movie characters were ok but disappointed when they didn't turn up when it was raining. The photo taking place was under cover....

The park is also perfect for families with kids, with a wide range of child-friendly rides and shows. My personal favourite was the Revenge of the Mummy ride, which was a thrilling rollercoaster that took me through dark tunnels filled with fire, mummies, and sudden drops. I also loved the Hollywood Dreams Parade, which featured colourful floats and lively performances that left me dancing and singing along. Overall, I had an amazing experience at Universal Studio Singapore and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore.

As both my kids were first time riders of the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, both my wife and I assured them that we will sit with them separately on the ride and they can sit in the middle for added safety since they are dinosaurs fan, just not rides, but we thought we let them try and hopefully like it. For context, 2 yrs ago my girl was 6yo and she would freak out even taking the Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase! She literally cried out loud during and after the ride! Nevertheless, we indicate to the staff at the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure that we are of 2pax each (My wife with my daughter, and myself with my son) so that both kids can sit in the middle. We were assigned a ride which already has a family of 3, so both my kids took the remaining middle seats and both my wife and I sat by their side. However there's an adult couple whom came over and told us that they are of 2pax and would like to sit together as two. Despite explaining to the staff our situation, eventually my daughter was made to sit at the other side of my son's, while I'm at the other end. And my wife had to extend herself to reach over to hold my girl's hand to calm her even before the ride began. I in the end tried to hold both my son's and daughter's hand throughout. Regardless of our best effort, both of my kids screamed and cried throughout the entire boat ride! No thanks to the staff's arrangement! Don't understand why we have to make such arrangement even though my family had already agreed and indicated to split up. They could have assigned single rider to sit on each of the other remaining sides. In any case, my kids decided not to come to USS anymore in future, no thanks to you USS! Lest to say, that was our last ride of the day, as we didn't take any further rides and cut short our day and left shortly after.",

The lockers are free for 40 minutes only. Afterwards you have to pay a fine of four Singapore dollars. A little further away, when the mummy returns, the lockers are free for 60 minutes and later even for 90 minutes. You can even take your cell phone with you on the roller coaster. But neither are backpacks. When the mummy returns there is a single line. But if it is too full it will also be closed. I was there when the park opened and managed to ride Galactica seven times and the Mummy six times. After that the park became so full that queuing was no longer fun. I also really liked the 4D animation Shrek... all in all a very nicely laid out park but quite small. No comparison to Euro Disney Europapark or Parque Aventura in Spain... If you decide early, you can get cheaper tickets from some providers. You can also book at the park on the day itself",

However, some rides were not operating due to Cyclone prediction (in Jurassic Park), Jurassic Park Rapids, but a must try are- Battlestar Galactica (go only if u love adventure and if you are not scared of height), Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers-SD, Shrek show if you are Shrek lover like us:). Things to keep in mind- better to fix a meeting spot and time with your family, as you are not allowed to carry phone and other items with you, so, tracking becomes an issue. Take a locker, keep your belongings there, fix a meeting time & spot, so, that you all can meet after a few rides....full day is needed, so, better to start early, carry a water bottle as you need to walk alot, so, staying hydrated is must. Wear sneakers or comfortable shoes, in which you can walk more and more....wear a cap and sunglasses, wear lot of sunscreen, as it is sunny most of the time and everyone in the family, keep some cash, so, that, even if you are away from other members, you can enjoy the yum food in Universal. A must in your Singapore trip, though we had been to Ferrari world- Dubai, but this surely was fun. *Tips- You can take an express pass, if you do not like to wait much and ready to pay double the price, Express que is separate, but relatively less waiting. We took the normal ticket and had to wait for 30-45min per ride.",

I would recommend to buy tickets in advance and plan your trip in advance to avoid disspointment at the entrance. We experienced that on a Saturday. I think it is pretty crowded on weekends. So it's good if you can avoid a weekend.",

I don't mean a sprinkle but downpour that an umbrella can't save you. (We loved it) The big rollar coaster takes forever to board compared to any roller coaster in the world and wins the worst smell on the b.o que. The mummy attraction is the best and a must do. Transformers was the popular attraction with a 50 min wait in September. The food was good and fresh for a theme park. (Keywords theme park) The cookie monster desserts were good. Other rides it was 10 to 30 min wait so not bad at all. Alot of cute photo ops. If you have kids, there is plenty to do. However, remember to plan around in case a surprise rain shower happens. Rain can be unpredictable in this climate and we knew that going in. Ladies, bring pads especially if you are late or think you skipped. They do not have anywhere or near the park. You will only be able to use toilet paper.",

That said, Universal is still great for thrill seekers and those that are 6 and above. Young kids will still enjoy the sights, meet n greets and the shows but there wont be as many rides for them. Ride lines can be long too, so if you dont have some patience, youll be in for a hell of a ride. If you have been to Japan and visited Universal Studios, Im led to believe this is a lot smaller, a bit more outdated and not as fun, so manage your expectations. Its also definitely no Disneyland but once again, manage those expectations and youll have fun!",

The map gained through scanning the qr code was a little help to plan to meet and greets, rides, and shows. Advised to bring ponchos or raincoats and a change so it saves cos not to buy a poncho and queue up for dryer. Sunscreen cream, if needed and water bottles, will be good. Kids below 122cm should always be accompanied by parents otherwise you can leave your little ones to have a little adventure.

Do carry your caps and a water bottle (If you do not want to buy water after every ride LOL) to protect yourself from all the heat and to keep the body hydrated.",

If you go diligently, you can try many different rides. The rides are definitely very fun, and the shows are of very high quality. If you work hard, you won't waste money I don't know if the kids are older, but it seems a bit difficult for younger kids. I think it's good that they put the express service in first",

In front of the bus stop, walk to the right and there will be a RWS8 bus stop. Pay cash for 1 per person. It takes about 20 minutes (good savings, get to sit and watch the view on the side of the road). Park at the Casino, walk straight, turn left and go up the escalator to the USS. Price comparison card from Klook Trip and Agoda Klook had a 10% discount so I got it for 1,980 baht, for the child it was 1,480 baht, bought it close to the day of the trip. Check the waiting time for the ride in the Universal SG app. The waiting time is not long, so don't buy Express. There are very few people inside, so you can play Transformer without having to wait in long queues. Then go to Jurassic Ride inside first, there are few people as well. Bags must be deposited in a locker for 4. Bring a raincoat. In conclusion, I didn't wear it and it didn't get as wet as I thought. (But other people were very wet) Played a lot of things. There were hardly any queues. Walking was comfortable. The weather was very hot. Download the app and look at meet&greet times. It helps a lot. Come take photos with the mascots and meet a lot of dinosaurs. Which rides stop being renovated when the park opens? Download the app to check in advance. Last time I played Mummy and almost fainted. I didn't play anything further. This time, I'm taking a break. 555 Enter the Goldilocks restaurant next to Puss in Boots. They don't accept cash. Visa and Mastercard only. You can use youtrip and tap to pay. The food is very expensive, but you can refill soft drinks and unlimited drinks. Sit and fill up the whirlpool until it's worth it. because of the hot weather The cotton candy kiosk next to the mummy requires cards only, no cash accepted. We planned to stay until closing but the children and elderly couldn't handle it. We returned at 4:30 p.m.",

For the show's there Shrek show is 4D and really good, and there are many other shows for kids like trolls , sesame Street show and also there will be small shows on the road itself going on every now and then . Food is pretty expensive there and not that good too. Keep less luggage as possible as you need to keep your belongings in locker for few rides and go.

I visited outside of the school holidays which definitely made the trip that much more pleasant and easy to navigate. Getting there via MRT was awesome. Another credit to the the super-efficient Singaporean government. And once you were in the Universal Studios park area, it seemed spacious, clean and lots to look at and do. There are so many rides (for all ages) and I have to say, I had a blast with my wife and seven year old son. One tip: pay for the premium ticket. Lines are long and it is worth every cent to not hang around and spend your time doing things. I ate at the Hawker's Market which was really inexpensive and actually pretty good. A great family day with so many good memories. Do it!",

My strong advise is to buy Express pass to avoid really really really long queues which may go from 60 mins upto 120 minutes in a intense humid day. Most rides are prioritised for Express pass holder which is really frustrating to wait and see them passing quickly and standard ticket holders being neglected and delayed almost in some rides. Pls be mindful that most of the big attractions are not for children below 4 years (height wise) so I dont recommend really to go with kids of that age as apart from gift shops, there is nothing really for them. For adults better buy a Express pass (allowed once per ride) or go alone in \"Single\" queue (incase allowed) as most of the time single queue is closed. One day is enough if u reach at 10am and come out at closing time. Overall the place is obviously great to be at. Rides to go for... 1. Jurassic Park Boat Ride 2. Revenge of Mummy Ride 3. Transformer Ride 4. Waterworld Hollywood Live show 5. Light Camera & Action Show",

It is filled with filmy entertainment, rides that give you adrenaline rush, truly fun activities for kids. Perfect for a day having fun with family and friends, this theme park has something special for everyone. The park is divided into various themed zones, each transporting you into a different cinematic universe. From the glitzy streets of Hollywood to the futuristic landscapes of Sci-Fi City, the attention to detail is impeccable. Walking through these zones feels like stepping into the movies themselves. The vibrant colors, iconic landmarks, and thematic music all contribute to an immersive atmosphere that captivates visitors from the moment they step in. It offers a wide variety of rides that cater to different age groups and thrill levels. The twists, turns, and inversions deliver an adrenaline rush that is hard to match. The Transformers: The Ride is an absolute highlight. This 3D dark ride combines cutting-edge technology with immersive storytelling to create an exhilarating experience that leaves you on the edge of your seat. For families with younger children, the Madagascar: A Crate Adventure boat ride and Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase offer fun and excitement without being too intense. These rides are beautifully designed with vibrant characters and engaging storylines, making them enjoyable for both kids and adults. The live shows at Universal Studios Singapore are not to be missed. The WaterWorld show, in particular, is a spectacular performance filled with high-octane stunts, pyrotechnics, and special effects. The cast is incredibly talented, and the show is packed with action from start to finish. Its a thrilling experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In addition to the shows, the character meet-and-greets are a big hit, especially with the younger visitors. Meeting iconic characters like Shrek, the Minions, and the cast of Madagascar adds an extra layer of magic to the day. The food options within the park are diverse, catering to various tastes and dietary preferences. Whether youre in the mood for a quick snack or a sit-down meal, theres something for everyone. The themed restaurants, not only serve delicious food but also add to the overall immersive experience. Prices are what youd expect in a theme park, but the quality and variety make it worth it. The staff at Universal Studios Singapore are friendly, helpful, and go out of their way to ensure that visitors have a smooth and enjoyable experience. Even on busy days, they manage the crowds efficiently, and the queues for rides move at a reasonable pace. Tips: Get there early to utilise full day and enjoy all attractions. The Express Pass can be a good investment on busier days, helping you skip the lines and enjoy more attractions. Dont forget to bring sunscreen, as much of the park is outdoors. Also, bring a pair of fresh clothes if youre planning on enjoying all water rides or buy ponchos from nearby stores in the park to protect yourself from getting wet. Most likely you will which is another kind of fun. A fresh pair of clothes will come in handy in these situations or if it rains.",

Thanks to her quick thinking, she helped locate my bag, which had been moved by another family to make more space.

As an adult, I wouldnt necessarily say its worth the visit unless youre here with children. For kids, however, its a different story. The park is very child-friendly, and all the rides, including the roller coasters, are designed specifically with younger visitors in mind. You wont find anything too extreme or thrilling, but the attractions are still engaging and fun for the little ones. What I did enjoy was the ambiance and how beautifully the park is built. The architecture and layout are thoughtfully designed, creating a charming and immersive atmosphere. The surrounding scenery adds to the overall experience, making it pleasant for a stroll even if you dont go on the rides. The pathways, landscaping, and themed areas really make the park feel magical, especially when taking your time to explore. In short, its definitely worth a visit if youre traveling with kids wholl appreciate the rides and attractions. As an adult, while the rides may not be the highlight, the overall setting and walkability of the park can still make it an enjoyable outing.",

I think it's better to buy tickets on the day when you arrive just in case the weather is not good. Big tip: wear an outfit with zip up pocket so that you can keep your phone on you while queueing and zip it up for the ride. All loose belongings and bags have to be left in a locker outside the ride or with someone not riding. I wanted to buy a rain cover for the raft ride but didn't have anything on me to use the vending machine. Also wear shoes that don't fall off. I really enjoyed the Shrek pancake.",

We visited in June, and it was sunny and hot, so we highly recommend bringing a portable fan, especially for kids. We bought our tickets online through Klook, which was much cheaper and more convenient than buying on-site. Definitely recommend purchasing in advance to save time and money! To make the most of your visit, we highly recommend arriving as soon as the park opens, as there are so many rides and shows to enjoyso plan your time wisely! While there werent many halal food options, it wasnt a big issue for us. Also, keep in mind that the toilets dont have bidets, so bringing a portable bidet would be useful. Overall, we had an amazing time enjoying the rides and attractions. Definitely a must-visit for families and theme park lovers!",

Some of the best rides we absolutely loved were Battlestar Galactica (both Cylon & Human), Transformers: The Ride, Revenge of the Mummy, and Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. Each ride was a thrilling experience, and the excitement never stopped! A word of advicegetting the Express Pass (around SGD 120 more) is totally worth it. It saves you from the long queues, ensuring you get the most out of your visit. Without it, the wait times can be quite long, especially on weekends and holidays.

Some areas were closed possibly for maintenance rotation but that just puts more pressure on the remaining attractions. There are attractions for adults only, but none specifically for kids. So, strangely enough, I wouldnt really recommend going with children. Youll end up waiting almost everywhere, which is really tough for kids. There are no charging stations, so make sure to charge your phones and bring a power bank. Otherwise, you might end up in a situation like we did: our express passes disappeared, and we couldnt order a taxi, so we had to walk back to the hotel about 5 km because we didnt have any cash on us. Out of all the attractions, we only really enjoyed a few the Shrek show, Transformers, and The Mummy.",

                  "review_text": "Universal Studios Singapore: Fun for Kids, But Expect Some Hiccups Universal Studios Singapore definitely offers a vibrant and exciting day out, particularly if you have kids in tow. The park is beautifully themed, and seeing characters like the Minions and Optimus Prime in real life brings a genuine sense of wonder to young faces. My children were absolutely thrilled by the Madagascar: A Crate Adventure boat ride and the Puss in Boots' Giant Journey suspended coaster when they were actually running. Unfortunately, our visit was significantly impacted by ride closures. The tropical climate of Singapore meant that several outdoor rides were temporarily shut down due to rain, which is understandable. However, we were also disappointed to find a noticeable number of attractions undergoing maintenance, further limiting our options. This was a real shame, especially for my kids who had been eagerly anticipating certain experiences. Despite the reduced ride availability, there was still enough to keep us occupied for a good portion of the day. The shows were entertaining, and the various themed zones offered plenty of photo opportunities and character meet-and-greets. The Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, even with the potential for getting soaked, was a definite highlight for the whole family. Food and beverage options within the park are plentiful, albeit on the pricier side, which is to be expected in a theme park. The staff were generally friendly and helpful, doing their best to manage the crowds and provide information about ride statuses. Overall, Universal Studios Singapore is a good experience, especially if your primary focus is entertaining younger children. The park has a unique charm and some genuinely fun attractions. However, the high likelihood of rain-related closures and the potential for maintenance disruptions mean it's not a guaranteed seamless experience. Would I say it's a must-visit in Singapore? Probably not. While we had a good time, the ride closures dampened the overall value proposition. If you have limited time in Singapore and prioritize must-see attractions, there might be other experiences that offer a more reliable and complete experience. However, if you have a few days, are traveling with kids who are big fans of the Universal franchises, and are prepared to be flexible with your itinerary due to potential ride disruptions, then Universal Studios Singapore can be a worthwhile one-time visit. Just be sure to check the park's website for any scheduled maintenance beforehand and be prepared to embrace the possibility of rain delays.",

I was particularly blown away by the Transformer ride a truly immersive and thrilling experience. The Minion and Shrek rides were also fantastic, providing a perfect blend of fun and entertainment. It's important to note that most rides require a minimum height of 102cm, so keep that in mind if you're traveling with young children. Shows: The shows are a major highlight! The outdoor dances, meet-and-greets, and other performances are incredibly engaging and well-executed. The Dinosaurs show is so realistic, it felt like we were witnessing actual prehistoric creatures! For children under 102cm, there are still plenty of opportunities to enjoy the shows from comfortable, stationary seating. Kid-Friendly Fun: My child absolutely adored the Minions and the meet-and-greet sessions. While the rides have height restrictions, the park offers a variety of shows and attractions suitable for younger children. Management and Amenities: The management of Universal Studios Singapore is truly commendable. Parking is well-organized, food options are diverse and delicious, and the park is impeccably clean. The overall organization and attention to detail are top-notch, making the entire experience seamless and enjoyable. The charges are fair for the level of entertainment provided.

As an Indonesian tourist visiting Singapore with my family, we were beyond excited for our Universal Studios Singapore adventure and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! From the moment we stepped into the park, the sheer excitement of the iconic movie sets and themed areas took our breath away. First up, we hopped into the world of Sesame Street with the Spaghetti Space Chase. My kids couldn't stop laughing as we joined Elmo and his friends on a fun and quirky space adventure. It was such a fantastic start to the day, setting the tone for all the thrilling rides ahead! Next, we zoomed into action with The Transformers Ride. WOW! The special effects and 3D action made us feel like we were right in the middle of a battle between Autobots and Decepticons. My heart was racing, and my kids were cheering every time Optimus Prime appeared on screen. A must-ride for any action movie fan! Then, we braved the darkness of Revenge of the Mummy, and let me tell you, this rollercoaster is not for the faint of heart! The combination of high-speed twists, turns, and eerie effects had us gripping the safety bars and screaming in excitement. Its a perfect mix of thrills and scares! We then took a more relaxed ride on Dino-Soarin', where my younger ones loved flying around in their very own pterodactyl while we marveled at the giant animatronic dinosaurs. It was a gentle and fun ride to catch our breath before diving into more action-packed experiences. For a moment of laughter, we jumped into the world of Shrek 4D Adventure. The movie was hilarious, and the 4D effects like water sprays and seat movements made us feel like we were part of the story. A great family-friendly experience! The Carousel was next, and we all enjoyed riding the beautifully crafted animals. It was a simple but nostalgic moment where even the adults had fun going around and around. The Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure was the highlight of the day. If you're looking for thrills and chills, this is the ride for you! The water splashes, the sudden drops, and the Jurassic creatures that pop up around every corner kept us on edge and soaked by the end of it! As fans of the adorable cat, we couldn't miss Puss in Boots' Giant Journey. It was a fun, whimsical ride, full of color, excitement, and of course, Puss in Boots' signature charm. Perfect for the whole family to enjoy together! Lastly, we ended the day in the vibrant and exciting Minion Land. My kids were ecstatic to meet their favorite Minions, and we all loved the fun, interactive rides. The bright colors, lively atmosphere, and Minion-themed attractions were simply a delight. Now, while we had an unforgettable time, there was one ride that didnt quite live up to the excitement of the others The Treasure Hunters. It was a slower-paced ride, and honestly, we found it a bit boring compared to the other more thrilling and immersive experiences. But with so many other fantastic attractions, this one small blip didnt take away from the overall fun! In the end, Universal Studios Singapore gave us a day full of thrills, laughter, and unforgettable moments. From heart-pounding rides to family-friendly fun, its an experience that will stay with us long after weve left. Whether youre a thrill-seeker or just looking for a day of joy with your loved ones, this park is the perfect destination. We left with our hearts full of memories and a promise to return. Trust me, this is one adventure you dont want to miss!",

Far Far Away was a family favorite, with the Shrek 4-D Adventure and the impressive castle making everyone feel like part of a fairy tale. What made the day truly special was how the park managed to cater to all their ages so seamlessly. While the older kids got their adrenaline fix on rides like Battlestar Galactica and Canopy Flyer, there were plenty of fun, age-appropriate attractions for our youngest toolike King Juliens Beach Party-Go-Round and Dino-Soarin. We also appreciated the clean, family-friendly spaces, quick service, and the kindness of the staff. The kids didnt stop smiling all day, and we left with tired feet, full hearts, and a promise to come back again.",

The park is super well-organized, clean, and full of fun vibes. We started off with the Transformers ride seriously one of the coolest 3D rides Ive ever been on. The kids were screaming (in a good way), and even the adults were hyped. Then we hit up Jurassic Park, got soaked on the river raft ride, and didnt even care because it was so much fun. One of the highlights? The Minion Mart and all the Despicable Me stuff my little cousin couldn't stop smiling. Oh, and dont miss the Revenge of the Mummy ride if you like a little thrill. Totally worth the wait! There are plenty of food options too from quick snacks to proper meals. We grabbed lunch at one of the themed diners and even found some halal choices, which was a plus for our family. Overall, it was such a wholesome day full of laughter, a bit of adrenaline, and tons of unforgettable memories. Whether you're with kids, teens, or just a bunch of fun-loving adults, Universal Studios Singapore is totally worth the trip!",

We highly recommend bringing a compact umbrella or poncho for sun protection (or sudden rain), and a portable fan to help beat the heat while walking between rides.

USS also renews its activities each season, real-life shows with guns and bombs like in the movies (Show WaterWorld), parades on weekends, Jurassic World reenactments or meetings with Minions, Gru, Optimus Prime... My ticket price is 1 million online, you can go straight in without buying a ticket.

We came there on a day when we didn't have to wait too long and also already had our ticket with the pre-bought Singapore pass (definitely recommended to get one!). The whole amusement park was very clean and organized. There are different theme worlds with breathtaking rides. Our favorites were the Transformers 4D adventure and a roller coaster called the Mummy. Even if a queue is long on some rides it is worth the wait, but I suggest to look for rides with short waiting times first so you can get the most of your experience as possible and go on more rides :) Another great thing was the Lights, Camera, Action!-Show, where you can see how all the effects on a real film set are done. If you are lucky you can meet a real dinosaur in the Jurassic Park environment ;) Our favorite show of that day was the Waterworld adventure, what was awesomely acted and constructed and even holds some nice surprises for you to see! But prepare to get wet, Another positive thing about the Universal Studios is that there are several water stations everywhere so you don't have to buy drinks all the time and can refill your bottles everywhere. If you are in Singapore take at least one day to visit the Universal Studios and get lots of fun!",

Also if you are staying in Singapore for a 1 week or more, may be you can add small amount of money and get the annual membership, so you can visit it as much as you can during your stay. Another advice, go very very early and try to go direct to the top attractions as after a while it will become crowded. Regarding Food, there is a Burger restaurant (Halal) which is moderate in price and their Burger is very delicious :) To get access to Universal Studio, there is a train from VivoCity, it was free but now I think it is 5SGD but not sure. There are free buses running in front of vivo city that take you to Sentosa Island. Really it is an amazing experience Really don't miss it",

The Mummy ride, Battlestar Galactica (Human and Cylon) are highly recommend. If you dont want to skip anything, its probably better if you carry a map with you. This place is full of surprises and quality entertainment, but the food however wasnt satisfactory for me. There are lockers available - free for a certain period of time, but youll have to pay after that timeline.",

There are many areas that are not found in Japan, so even people who have been to USJ can enjoy it. Also, unlike other Universal parks, Jurassic Park in Singapore was a circular ride. Overall, it was more watery than in Japan, but when I sat in the seat, I was soaked from head to toe. There is a dryer outside the ride for a fee, and you can go inside to dry your whole body, but it's a good idea to bring your own towel. There are more types of roller coasters than at USJ, and they move in a different way (speeding up and running) than in Japan, so if you like roller coasters, you should give them a try. There were fewer shops than in Japan, and there were fewer souvenirs to hand out.",

The event like 4D transformers,boat ride( dinosaurs roaring) is extremely breathtaking, adventures, thrilling so on, especially the last part and the dark place in the tunnel was really amazing.though it is forbidden to take pictures but many tourist like me tried to take pictures hidden way. The Water Works which is I think a live rare experience that can give us much more thrills than one can expect. I must say what a show!!!. The 4D show Shreak was spellbinding which was liked by all my family members especially my son. He just simply loved it as well as we. More attractive things that gave us a lifetime experience and memories that we never forget.",

You can see some dummy characters also there .. don't lose opportunity to click a photo with them. If possible don't forget to take express pass. It will take 30 min to 3 hours waiting for some shows in peak times. It will cost 50 more for each ticket. Start day early n see many shows. All the best. For lunch try one restaurant opposite to mummy ride. There you will get veg chicken mutton Biryanis. Even parathAs too. It will be around 800/- each plate.",

Transformers Ride. Man. The details put into developing this rode is amazing and one would want to go for it again and again. 3.Mummy Ride. High paced nice ride for a small duration. Like a rollercoaster with attraction to keep you attentive. 4. The Jurassic park Lost world kingdom. Nice rides getting you through the demolished Jurassic park. And a canopy ride to have a overview or complete lost world 5. Shrek show in the Far Far away world. Amazing castle and nice details there. 6. Madagascar ride. Nice and calm ride to give you some light moments between Alex Marty Gloria and Melman along with the Penguins. More to give a detailed insight. Experience it yourself. Don't miss the show by Stephen Spielberg on Movie making. It's nicely rendered. Numerous shops selling merchandise. And Minions store. Everything is catchy and nice.

Here the rides are well maintained, different branded shops and food courts are well maintained. People can enjoy a perfect vacation here and meet new people, culture and charms! My advice is to keep two consequent days for visiting universal studios. Theres several hotel around it but they are bit costly. Rather you can stay in the city as you can easily get there within an hour. This is the beauty of Singapore! I have visited many countries but Singapore would always remain my first choice to enjoy my vacations. Hope to visit there soon again!",

As the 4th Universal Studios theme park in the world, its the smallest but still has 24 attractions across seven themed zones built around a central lagoon. I show you all of these in this video and share tips on how to get the most of any visit here. The zones are: Hollywood, Madagascar, Far Far Away, The Lost World, Ancient Egypt, Sci-Fi City and New York. There are 30 restaurants and food carts across the park. A big plus is that over 70% of the park is covered to protect you from the Singapore heat and rain storms.",

A fun place to visit.it has Many rides and shows...you can also see live parades and performances. This is a very lively place. Come for a day with your friends and family and you won't regret it... Just make sure not to go on weekends...you might die in crowd.. choose Monday for your visit and you will be happy with short queues and lesser crowd... Visit around 10AM in morning and get the most of it till the evening. If you arrive late, you would regret it... To make hour tickets worth, try all the rides where available! Transformers 4D show is 1 of the best! So is the interactive Donkey(from Shrek)! Had fun with the kids. Jurassic park will be at its best when the dinosaur is set free to interact with tourists! Please remember to bring along a poncho if u want to stay dry during the Jurassic ride. Water world is offering a great insight to pyrotechnics & action in movies. Worried about the actors safety as the performance area is considered quite tight. Frankly speaking, I am amazed by their stunts! Great job!",

One can go to Sentosa using a boardwalk (free of cost), by Mono Rail (2-4 approx) or by cable car as well. The roller coasters are the best thrill. The grey one (galactic x) was the best one I felt. I was such amazed to find Roller coaster with 4D effects (Transformers ride, though not a roller coaster but the cabin you sit in feels that it is actually moving, flying in sync with the actions) and the Mummy roller coaster with a haunting dark THE MUMMY experience. There are also these various cartoons which come out from time to time and you can have photos with your favorite one. The water world show ( A war in water ) is also a must attend, it is very realistic and feels like a real scene. I saw 5 pm show but there are also a couple more timings. There are also many other little shows/programs and you need to have a map and show planner to neatly plan out which ones to attend. To summarize the most important shows/rides. - Battlestar Galactica ( A red and a grey colour roller coaster ) - The Mummy ride - Transformers - Water World Also note there are two lines for any ride, normal one and exclusive (expensive ticket). Normal lines can even have hours of waiting time !! Also note some rides also have single riders, where if you are alone you can just get in single rider line ( ask for one at the gate itself ) and there is very less waiting time, and you are adjusted with others where the odd seats of the ride cabins are left out !",

Even a local teacher in Singapore who took primary school students to play was brutally investigated. It was like the airport. The Chinese female teacher was dumbfounded. Haha, by the way, the primary school students are all Chinese. The official website said you can bring snacks, but you got yelled at for bringing snacks. Maybe honey star is a staple food in the West, so she said no if you bring a small box hahaha The nice little snacks were generously given to the cinema staff. The Chinese female staff were dumbfounded and asked why they were so strict. They didnt even give it to them for the whole day. Their mood was affected. Second time, everyone, be careful. Chinese people should be careful. It is best to go empty-handed and leave this racist lunatic with nothing to say. Dont take it out on tourists.

There is no more sincere laughter and happiness than in amusement parks anywhere The number 1 place for me in Singapore was Universal Studios I could easily refuse any other attractions except this one. The park is located on Sentosa Island and you can get there on foot from Harbourfront station, by monorail for 4 round trip or by cable car for 26. We are spoiled by cable cars, we decided to save our legs (god, no thanks for this idea) and went on the monorail. It runs frequently, the ride takes 5 minutes. I booked tickets to the park through the #klook app, its really much cheaper. Tickets cost us 104 for two for the whole day, if you buy in the park, then 140. The park is open every day from 10 to 18. I was afraid of the rain in the forecast and we went on Sunday, I thought if there were queues, wed buy an express train passage Madagascar, Faraway Kingdom (Shrek and the Cat), The Lost World (Jurassic), Egypt, Galactic Wars, Transformers and New York. The last one is the most useless. Each zone has themed attractions, restaurants, shops and shows. And the coolest attractions, in my opinion, were (from less cool to more cool): 4. Galactic.

If you have the time, I highly recommend visiting. We stayed at the Le Mridien Singapore hotel, so we easily walked (they also have a free monorail).",

With an Express Pass, you can ride one ride smartly, but only once. However, although it is a little expensive, I definitely recommend purchasing it. For popular attractions, there may be a wait of 2 to 3 hours. With the pass, you can ride all the attractions in the evening and have time to choose souvenirs! However, I was disappointed that some attractions ended at noon. Personally, I think the water show is very authentic and worth seeing! I didn't really worry about attractions that said \"be careful not to get wet\", but I ended up getting very wet (lol). Are the regulars wearing raincoats? I was wearing. The food may be average or not what you would expect. Don't you need to clean up after eating? It seems OK to leave the dishes on the table as is. (There is no return slot) Singapore is a beautiful country, and perhaps because of its thorough cleaning, there was no trash left and I was able to enjoy my stay very comfortably. It makes sense that prices are the highest in the world (lol) However, it is the number one country I would like to visit again!",

To get to the USS, the first option is to walk via the Sentosa Boardwalk. Apart from being able to enjoy the view, this road is open 24 hours... so that visitors don't get tired, a travelator (flat escalator) is provided, when I came here it was still being built so I haven't tried it yet... According to the source, the fee is 1, you can tap the ez link The second is the bus option, when I went there I tried to take the bus, the fare was 2, you looked for the RWS8 bus to Resort World Sentosa. The cost is around 2, you can use ezlink or exact change. Take the free shuttle bus, which is intended for tourists... this bus passes two routes, namely the marina and orchard which passes several hotels on the route. Don't forget to prepare your passport if you want to take the shuttle bus. The third option is to take the monorail, from VivoCity go up to the 3rd floor, the cost of the ride is 4, you can use ezlink The fourth option is to take the cable car, the location is near the Harbourfront MRT, btw, this is expensive, guys, around 15, if I'm not mistaken, exclude the Sentosa entry ticket, if you include the entrance ticket, it's around 35... hmmm... Another option is to take a grab or taxi to Sentosa...",

Try all of the rollercoasters and rides you can try, and if you have time, do it more than once. The food is also extremely good there, so when youre feeling hungry, grab yourself a delicious snack. The safety there is also top notch!! If youre ever hesitant to try this, please please please just do it. Its going to be one your best experiences ever!

I have personally visited four times here and this place is indeed one of the best tourist attractions in Singapore. Situated in Sentosa Island ,tickets can be bought online or offline. On showing the tickets at the entrance they will give u a band/pass which will give entry to all rides and attractions inside the amusement park. Among all the rides I liked the roller coaster , mummy ride and transformer ride in the sci fi city. There are restaurants inside the park where one can have snacks or lunch. There is speilburgs studio which gives an idea on how VFX is used to give realistic view by using light and sound. Overall it's a great place for weekend destination in Singapore and it will take a day to explore all the things inside the park.",

Singapore Branch: It is very beautiful and I recommend visiting it, but its only drawback is the high entry prices! Especially when purchasing express boarding tickets . Its location in Singapore: on Sentosa Island, specifically at Resorts World Sentosa . The amusement park is divided into seven parts (Hollywood, Ancient Egypt, New York, Madagascar, The Lost World, The Future, and Fantasy Movie Celebrities) . What are the activities at Universal? - It contains 15 games (if I am not disappointed) divided between children and adults. - It has live shows, the most beautiful of which is (The Water Show), which is a very beautiful live action comedy film through which you can see how action films are made - It has the Hollywood Walk of Fame - You can take pictures with characters such as (Shrek and Princess Fiona - Pussy in Boots - Madagascar characters - Minions - Sesame World - Transformers) - There are gift and souvenir shops - There are (halal) restaurants, and I repeat the word (halal) because before traveling I asked and they told me to take food with you, there are no halal restaurants!! I was surprised by three restaurants with the (Halal) logo, even though I was not careful to search and did not see the rest of the restaurants. Maybe they are all halal after all (The restaurants I saw were halal: one in the fantasy films section, one in the Madagascar section, and one in the ancient Egypt section) . Experienced advice when visiting Universal: - It is best to visit it on other weekends to avoid severe crowding - Attend at the beginning of the day so that all the games can be played - Buy an express boarding ticket in case there is crowding, because the wait at the games is very long, reaching from half an hour to a full hour sometimes. - Ask about show times when entering . Prices: Large: 74 Small: 54 Express Boarding: Add 30 to the ticket, whether large or small . Working hours 10am - 8pm .

Advisable to bring along umbrella due to the recent rainy weather. Also they won't take pictures for you due to current situation. No touching, no shaking hands with them, and they'll let you stand at a line to selfie. Selfie sticks recommended. Safety Ambassadors are everywhere to make sure you're social distancing while queuing for rides. Most of the rides require 120cm and above (else accompanied by adult).

Travellers in Singapore should plan for spending one day checking out universal studios. I am sharing a quick review of a few areas that attracted me and I am planning to bring my family members here. We have visited Madagascar on the first ride after entering USS and if you didnt see the movie, then also you will enjoy the show. A lot of rush in The Lost World especially for Jurassic themed land but great attraction and fun to attend a live stunt show at WaterWorld. Ancient Egypt is one of the attractions here and riding is too much exciting but not suitable for little kids. There are some interesting Egyptian themed characters around. Visiting the New York zone is another excitement and I am lucky enough to arrive at the time of some great street dancing where visitors also participated. I have also liked the Hollywood zone mostly about shopping and kids must love to have a look at the shops. Amongst all the rides and shows, I will love to enjoy the ride once again that is Transformers The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle. This is just an unbelievable and awesome experience that all visitors must attend as I cant explain how I was amazed by the show and it was too good. I loved it all the way and enjoyed every second of the ride.",

Few tips I would like to share which I knew earlier which helped me a lot. 1. Bring some food. I would say a lot . You would be a very very hungry during all the rides and the food inside is bit costly 2. Take a big bottle of water. Be hydrated all the time. There is dispenser and wash rooms all over the place 3. Check your locker timing. After 120 minutes it's chargeable. So what you can do is takeout your stuff and place again with different a locker 4. Go for rollercoaster first. It will remain busy until the end. So be sure you make it there within the first few. Then comeback and enjoy the rest 5. I will suggest you take an express pass. But I found it useless if you are travelling alone or you guys have the vibe of going to every rides alone then you can save around 60 to 70 SGD. There is a line for single riders which is pretty quicker than express pass. But keep in mind it will not work in rollercoaster. 6. I would suggest you allways take someone with you so that you have someone who can take pictures for you since there is a lot to click. Also take a selfie stick which cost hardly 3 SGD. This also gives you a good company. 7. If rank then my order would be rollercoaster, mummy ride, transformers ride, Jurassic park ride, pic with talking transformers, minions, etc, pics in hollywood, newyork, etc. All above are my personal views from my personal experience yours might differ. Verdict : A day full of fun",

I really enjoyed Jurassic world and far far away (Shrek). Weather was extremely hot so make sure to bring water to hydrate . Plenty of awesome gifts and toys to purchase. I would definitely visit againNice place to play and have fun with kids/families. Apart from the attractions, store and Food places, be mesmerized by stunning hidden spots for photo taking and styling! Both with strong (noon time) like and soft (eve/night time), some examples at the area just thru the alley beside Camera & Action.It's definitely awesome place to go. We've been to Universal Studio Japan before. Relevantly its size is smaller than Japan but it's good size not too big walk around. I used Universal express tickets and I strongly recommend to use it. We used several times in specific attractions. It's recommend to go !!Well, I would like to give 4 and half stars as currently a few rides are closed, however Human and Mummy are amazing rides and they are working very well... Transformers indoor ride is interesting as well...Don't forget to carry your shades and cap as it is an outdoor theme park... A few rides don't allow you to carry loose items with you so you need to either keep them I'm a locked which will cost you a couple of extra bucks or you will have to give your luggage to a non rider...It was fun but wasn't very pleasant too as not all rides were functioning at the same time. This is not the usual, probably due to Covid safety measures. Opening hour has been shifted to 12 pm and closing time has also been adjusted to 7pm instead of 9pm. This forced visitors to leave the park and miss the opportunity to take photos of the night scene and also to enjoy dinner at the park. Kind of disappointing actually.Great place with kids and family. I always loved this place!! Been there millions of time. Only update now is that some of the rides are open at certain times. Just check before you buy your ticket. Madagascar Old side was closed and was only open part was the king Julians Goround. Before you take the Express ticket think twice. Because we could do only few ride and of course due to weather safety and the time restrictions its very hard to run around. Just dont waste the money until they fully open to have fun. But other than that always a great place for kids to adults and families to spend their time. Enjoy!It was an amazing experience with family there. One of the best places to be visited in Singapore. The minimum age for kids to ride is 4 but few rides allow them based on their height too. Kids above 4 years are chargeable so make sure you take a ticket for them. And have FUN.It's like a Luna park in case you don't know , the entrance fee is big something like more than 120 dollars each. I guess if you want to do a lot of roller coaster, it is worth. But I wouldn't pay that much money ti see a playground considering it is located to sentosa Island and you are going to spend minimum 300 dollars per person. For though will be great. It is really crowded and the temperature make it hard to enjoy",

Get to MRT station of Harbourfront and then a 5 minutes train directly to the park from Vivocity mall. 2) Price is just fair. 3) The park has a total of around 8 rides (some for kids and some for adults) in addition to some other activities (4D movies and etc.) 4) The park is convenient and quite small, so you can really have it covered in a full day. 5) The atmosphere and theme of the park are amazing. Everything is done really well and into the details. Some disadvantages: 1) Some of the rides might be closed randomly on days you come. You just have to find out(no worries though, the main ones are active) 2) I visited on a a moderately low day. In high season waiting can be over an hour and even longer for most rides. Honestly I dont think the most are worth waiting more than 45 minutes tops except for the top best rides. But thats a more personal thing. 3) The park is real fun, but having said point number 2, the best of the park really comes down to 3-4 rides (for those who love the adrenaline), which are always really busy and waiting is long. To sum up - Amazing experience, be prepared for some waiting on busy days. Dont miss it if you are in Singapore",

It is really rare to have tsukemen in Taiwan. The first time I tried it, I really thought it was great. I both liked it spicy and numb. I chose the incremental line and added a portion of meat, but the meat was a bit deducted. Their barbecued pork is the three-layer fat type, but about half of the meat I got was a whole piece of fat... This is It's really a little disappointing, but the meat is very fragrant and delicious overall. It's just that I haven't eaten something so greasy in a long time. The dipping sauce is also on the oily side, and the meat is actually full of fat... I really feel like my femoral vessels are getting clogged after eating it. It feels like staying here, but fortunately the fried bean sprouts in the store are really delicious and not greasy. Otherwise, people who dont usually eat greasy food will have to think about it. Overall, the taste is very good, so you can come here. A store to try.",

There are lot of live activities by the characters themselves and allow you to click pics with them, with a good thing also being you can click using your own camera or phone as well apart from their official click. While their entrance ticket gives entry to pretty much all the attractions, a special pass called Express Pass will help you skip the long waiting lines of upto 40-60 mins on some of the attractions, especially the fast moving rides. You can buy the Express Pass over the counter which costs SGD 50 for one time use for applicable shows but can cost lesser sometimes if booked online. There are multiple food outlets too if different cuisines and named after some of their shows or themes. The park itself is divided into different zones basis their various shows.

But it's not a problem. We played the first 3 and almost vomited. Transformers, we lost to 5D a lot. We went out to rest and eat burgers. Continue with the rides in the Egyptian zone. Nothing at all. This one is very funny. For small children, it would be more appropriate than the name treasure hunt. Continuing on with the rides that we thought the kids were going to have, the dragons took them on a roller coaster. We like the Egyptian zone, take beautiful photos. Forget to look and see if there is a souvenir shop in the Egyptian area. But the restaurant is beautiful. Some restaurant sections are a bit too small. Because there are a lot of tourists Even on weekdays When we eat, we feel hungry at the same time. Every store is full. Luckily we were hungry a while ago so we had a seat Traveling alone, I don't get many photos. But overall I really like it. Come capture the atmosphere. P.S. You can buy your own USS entrance ticket through the vending machine in front of the entrance. In simple English, we pay by credit card. On the way, take bus number 123 from Hotel Mirama. On the way back, take the Skytrain Sentosa, get off at vivo city mall, then take the purple line, north east line, get off at outtarm, then connect to the brown line to havelock, walk a bit to our hotel.

You would usually think about purchasing an Express Pass, but I think an Express Pass is a must. If you like rides, I recommend Unlimited. We purchased the regular express, but it was a bit disappointing because we wanted to ride it again later. It seems that rides often break down, and in the case of popular Transformers and Mummy rides, it seemed like it would be really hard to wait unless you took the express. For souvenirs, we recommend stopping by the souvenir shop before entering Universal to look through them and then make your selection. Surprisingly, there were souvenirs that were only found outside. Food is a bit expensive, but it's acceptable considering it's the cost of not going out in hot weather. Meet and Greet is a must! I recommend watching at least one when you have the time. It's a little clumsy, but it's more fun than I thought. It's a bit disappointing that the Madagascar area is currently being remodeled, but I'm looking forward to how it will change when it reopens later.",

'Transformers The Ride' is the most innovative, 'Revenge of the Mummy' has the best theme, and the 'Battlestar Galactica' looks most iconic on the outside with its two intertwining tracks. Furthermore, I really liked the Shrek themed area, Far Far Away. Not so much because of the attractions, but mainly because of the atmosphere. Just like Singapore itself, every square meter of the park has its purpose. Every attraction is always within a few minutes walking distance. This makes the visit not as exhausting as visiting other amusement parks. Unlike Singapore, the food was expensive and did not look that good. Tip: go outside of the park to have lunch in the area just outside of Universal Studios. You can leave and come back for free, and the food outside is tastier and less expensive. The park is building new areas, which is needed because the current attractions might become a little outdated in the coming years. I will definitely come back once those areas are completed!",

The newly built \"Minion Park\" is expected to be completed in phases by 2025. However, there are already many Minions in the park, but I personally feel that the characters from Sesame Street are still the main attraction. Universal Studios Singapore is divided into seven themed areas: Hollywood, New York, New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, and Madagascar... Before the trip, I read on the Internet that there were relatively few people and queues on weekdays, but when I arrived at the venue, I found out, yes! Sure enough, the Internet cant completely believe itBut maybe everyone is comparing it to the standard of Universal Studios Japan after the lockdown is lifted. If so, I still agree... There are indeed a lot less people However, there are still many things worth seeing inside. People who like to visit amusement parks in Singapore can still visit here!",

A vending machine with a large sales volume The park will not help to deal with the failure, it feels like a tiger eating dumplings Since it is located in the tropical zone, the park is not very big.

Universal Studios Singapore is the second Universal Studios in Asia, second only to Universal Studios Osaka. It is also the smallest Universal Studios in the world with the cheapest tickets. Universal Studios Singapore covers an area of 20 hectares and took three years to build. It is the only movie theme park in Southeast Asia. It is no exaggeration to say that it is a dream-come-true paradise for adults and children. Universal Studios Singapore is located in Resorts World Sentosa, which cost SGD 7 billion (approximately NT 168.7 billion) to build. Travelers can take the Singapore MRT and get off at Harbourfront Station. After arriving at Vivo City, 01. Transfer to Sentosa Express: The fare is SD4 (about NT. 93), which can be paid with an Ez-link card. You can take it unlimited times without leaving Sentosa. It takes about 5 to 10 minutes and the operating hours are 07:00 to 24:00. You can take the Sentosa MRT on the 3rd floor (Lobby L) of VivoCity, and to Universal Studios, just take the Waterfront MRT Station. PS. If you are staying in Sentosa, you can exchange your free island entry ticket by showing your hotel check-in certificate to the light rail ticket counter staff. Take your ticket to the manual ticket checker and you can enter the island for free. The hotel will also give you a free ticket to enter the island, which means you can leave the island once and then enter Sentosa for free!",

Starting from the accommodation at 10.00 Dunloop Street, walk towards Little India to take the MRT to Vivo City. Arriving at Vivo City we go straight to the bus stop, there is a special stop for Sentosa - HarbourFront Stn, about 30 minutes with views of the city across the bridge until we arrive at USS yeaaaaaa.. Alone on the USS? yup, explore on your own, (noted: you have previously ordered USS tickets on OTA, guys) so when you arrive at USS, take a photo first in front of the Universal Studios Singapore icon. Erm, because I was alone, I was brave enough to ask another tourist to take a photo, hehehe... armed with it, Hi miss, can you help me to take a picture here? Luckily they want to, or sometimes take photos instead. Wait, if you go to USS, your provider doesn't have a signal, don't worry. Because at USS there is public wifi that can be used. It's a good idea if you go to USS to download the Universal SG app, why? because with this application you can know the location of rides and waiting times in line. Very useful for those of us who want to try all the rides. Because I'm alone, I can really queue at Single Rider, a queue that complements the regular queue where they usually want to ride at the same time as friends or family, honestly this saves a lot of time. Yes, although not all rides can do it. Every certain time there is a show like that, you can check the app for the schedule, so we can take photos with several icons, come here Minnion tunes, transformers etc. There are several rides where it's best not to bring luggage (for example hats, glasses, cellphones) you can store them in a locker first, it's free within a certain time limit. You can try all the rides, the most impressive one is of course the Sci-Fi City ride on the Human Battlestar Galatica, I wanted to try the Cylon one but the queue was 80 minutes at that time, it was really long, The second ride that is a must try is in Ancient Egypt, you have to enter through a long corridor with a very mummy atmosphere, you get a really scary feel, riding a train in the dark. At the end there will be a photo of us taken while riding the ride, you can also ask for a print, hello. The third ride is at Lost World, Canopy Flyer and again it is great for single riders. Really like the Far Far Away location, the location is really beautiful.",

There are no attractions to take photos of, so there were quite a few young people who were enjoying themselves as single riders, even if they came in groups. In addition, I thought the prices of goods in the park were well, this is what it is'', but the food is expensive.

Everywhere, even in the middle of the games, there are food and sweets stalls everywhere, halal and non-halal restaurants are available",

I always like amusement parks and have been to Universal Studios in other countries, but this one is small but mighty!? I got the feeling that although the place itself is not big, it had a lot of really impactful rides and it was worth the money just to be able to see shows like Water World. There were a lot of rides for younger children to ride and a lot of things to see. The ride itself was such a refreshing shock and fun. If I visit Singapore again, I think it will be because of this place. However, there were too many choices when purchasing tickets, so it was a bit annoying for someone like me. I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to narrow it down to just two or three.",

They say they were sold out within 2 hours of opening. I think it's because it's the end-of-year season. There was also a VIP ticket that included an express and private guided tour, but it was about 400 per person, so I thought about it but decided against it. In the end, it was a good thing I didnt buy it! Because it was a rainy day, there were times when people flocked to certain attractions. If you download the Universal Map app (required) and watch the real-time waiting times (make sure to bookmark things to ride, see, and eat in advance), you will be able to enjoy the experience efficiently. Since a lot of children come here, if you get the timing right, you can ride without having to wait, and if you're not afraid of rain, you can ride even more comfortably haha. Attraction Recommendations & Recommendations - Siron is more fun than Human - I didn't like Shrek 4D... - Transformers 3D front row seat recommended - Highly recommend the Water World show! - Mummy Recommendation - Jurassic Park Rapids recommendation (everything is wet. Everything is wet.) - Spaghetti is completely for babies haha. Recommended if you like cute things. -The Indian restaurant was delicious. - Most souvenirs are available at the universal shop at the entrance, so there is no need to stop by each shop. Additionally, Sentosa Island has ziplines and luges, so it would be nice to spend a day enjoying them all. After getting wet and raining, it got cold as the sun went down, so I bought a Shrek blanket and covered myself with it. I think it would be a good idea to bring a raincoat, towel, and blanket if you can. You never know when it will rain in Singapore.",

I found the park more geared toward children, but adults can also have fun. The outdoor areas are a very interesting experience and reflect the country's history well. When I was there in February 2024, there was a construction site for a new attraction. I faced a few lines, and in one of them there was a technical stoppage with no forecast for the ride to return. I found this frustrating, because they were encouraging people to give up. I was at the front, and if I gave up, I would have to wait in line when the rides started working again. The right thing to do would be to clear the line and close the ride. The best thing to do is to download the Universal app, where you can favorite the rides you want to go on, and in the app you can track the queue time. The problem is that you can't follow the route in sequence, and you go back and forth to places when the queue is shorter. The best time to avoid waiting in line is at the end of the day. Then the queues are much shorter. Just pay attention to the shows, which have limited times. As for food, there are some options that aren't so cheap, but I didn't think they were exorbitantly priced. I went there and came back using a ride-hailing app to save time, but on the way back the drivers don't accept rides, and it's more expensive than the outward journey. The island and the area near the park are also very beautiful attractions. If you have time on your trip and are traveling with young people and children, it's a good experience. We stayed there until the park closed.",

We can have multiples of canopy ride, rapids as well as bird ride. It is never enough! In the Egypt theme, treasure hunt is perfect for an easy ride through the history. The mummy roller coaster was scary as hell! It became pitch dark and ultra fast. It's not for the faint-hearted, mind you. Sci-fi city is good as always. Transformers as well as the roller coasters are one true must have. Every theme park has a separate food court, ice cream parlors, rest rooms. Water world has lot of amazing rides and in my opinion needs one whole separate day to enjoy! Do not forget to take universal express passes to skip those lines. Else, you will end up missing many awesome rides due to timeout. Overall USS is a unique experience and should not be missed when you visit Singapore!",

Universal studios has been a dream come true, I've always wanted to visit the universal studios. We didn't have an express pass but we didn't have to wait for too long to experience the rides. It's a magical experience and it's a must to visit if you're in Singapore. The kid in me wants to go back in time and visit the studio again. The washrooms are extremely clean and the rides and attractions are out of the box. Superb effort taken by the country!",

I decided to try the battlestar galactica human coaster and it was really good as well as revenge of the mummy both I would highly recommend. If you have the extra cash to spend buy an express pass it is a lifesaver when it comes to skipping the queues especially for Battlestar galactica.",

We Adults & Kids definetly love this, sometimes we think, we need to go the ride again & again. Best attractions which we shouldn't miss is Roller coster, Jurassic park rapid adventure, Canopy flyer, Avengers, Transformers, Revenge of Mummy etc., My badluck during visit is Revenge of Mummy is closed for maintenance. Every attractions is excellent. Better to start early in the day, make sure that we reach there by 9:30 am. Better to take MRT & bus to reach here. If we want to avoid waiting in queue, need to buy VIP pass, which costs more. For many attractions, the photography / video is not allowed. For some rides like jurassic park rapid adventure, bags are not allowed to take as there are high chances of getting wet. Few of them carry / purchase the rain covers to protect them from water. People who come early, first visit the attractions like Transformers, Avengers, Mummy etc., so there will be huge queue in front. If we want to avoid queue, better to come from last, so that we can avoid queues. Visit these attactions post the lunch, so that it will be empty. Food: - Food is costly here, we can carry some snacks / food to save money. Photo package: - People try to come and ask you to take photo package with unlimited photograph. If we take the package, sometimes the server will not work and finally we will end up of getting multiple tags. Consolidating photos from multiple tags will be tedious. Meet & Greet We can meet lot of characters like minions and few others and take photos. There are people who help to take photos with this characters using our phone. They take lot of photos too, so no worries. Though the ticket is costly, but it is worth to spend to enjoy. Make sure spending entire day till 5-6 pm, so that we dont miss any attractions.",

From heart-pounding rides to delightful food options, USS truly knows how to deliver a memorable day. Here are some highlights: 1. Roller Coaster Cylon: This ride is an absolute must-try! Its the most thrilling roller coaster Ive ever been on. The twists, turns, and sheer speed will leave you breathless and wanting more. A definite highlight of the park! 2. Transformers 3D Ride: Prepare to be blown away! This ride is more than just a simulatorits an immersive experience. Wearing 3D glasses, youre thrust into the world of Transformers as your ride car moves and reacts to the action. It genuinely feels like youre part of the movie. Hands down, the best ride Ive ever been on! 3. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure: If you love water rides, this is for you! Get ready to be soaked as you navigate through thrilling rapids. Pro tip: bring a poncho and an extra T-shirt and socks, because you will get wet. Its an absolute blast! 4. Halal Food Options: For my fellow Muslim visitors, you can enjoy delicious halal fried chicken at Goldilocks. Its not just convenient but also incredibly tasty! 5. Exceptional Staff: A massive shoutout to Hanafi and Boon from the USS team. Their friendliness and impeccable customer service made our visit even more enjoyable. Special thanks to Hanafi for going above and beyond by iron steaming my new KungFu Panda T-shirt. You guys are amazing! While my day at USS was fantastic, there are a few areas where the park could elevate the experience even further. Some rides and attractions could use a bit of upgrading and touch-ups to maintain their top-notch quality. Additionally, the Naruto Gallery currently showcasing at USS has a lot of untapped potential. Right now, it mostly features posters and background stories of beloved characters like Naruto, Sasuke, Jiraiya, and Orochimaru. Given the massive fanbase for Naruto both inside and outside of Singapore, introducing more interactive and engaging elements could make this gallery a major attraction. Overall, Universal Studios Singapore is a phenomenal theme park with an array of thrilling rides, great food options, and standout staff. Its a perfect destination for a fun-filled day. I highly recommend visiting and cant wait to see how USS continues to innovate and improve!",

I spoke to Mr. Lynne to allow my guests for a re-entry once they have consumed their food, and they will enter back to Universal Studio Singapore. Lynne was of great help to allow my guests to be re-entry. I would also like to greatly appreciate the assistance of Ms. Rosemary and Mr. Karthik in ensuring that the guests are given a re-entry stamp.

And when you visit this place, you can immediately notice that there are a lot of people because it is famous. I have been here and among the things I think about, I highly recommend riding the roller coaster. It is really thrilling to ride that ride. If you go nearby, there are a lot of people, so it's a very important and nerve-wracking moment to get a girlfriend. If there's a pretty girl, make sure to date her, please. And the downside is that because there aren't too many people, the waiting time for the ride is so long that you can't even talk, so I think it's very important and recommended to visit in the morning right before business hours.",

If you don't have an express ticket, you have to go at 9 o'clock, otherwise you really need an express ticket. Admission tickets are around 80,000 won express tickets are around 90,000 won... It's really expensive. No matter how hot it is, people explode. It's nice that there are facilities so you can wait in the shade even if the waiting line is long, but the standard waiting time is over 50 minutes. If you don't have an express ticket, raise your hand quickly and use it when a single ride seat becomes empty. I didn't know what it was, but found out later. There is a locker at the entrance for about 12 for 4 hours. Payment is made by card, but Amex cards rarely work in Singapore. Go inside and there is a storage box near Egypt(?), but there are a lot of people, so let's leave it at the entrance. There aren't many places to buy souvenirs or drinks. It's crowded near the entrance, and the further you go inside, the more rides there are. It is not sold everywhere like Everland. If you see a place selling something, I recommend buying it right away. When entering a restaurant, the group will take a seat and one person will go to order food.",

Nestled within the Resorts World Sentosa, this theme park offers an impressive array of attractions, shows, and dining options that cater to visitors of all ages. As soon as I entered the park, I was struck by the vibrant atmosphere and the detailed theming of each zone. From the futuristic landscapes of Sci-Fi City to the enchanting streets of Far Far Away, every area is beautifully designed and immersive. The iconic Hollywood Boulevard sets the stage perfectly with its charming shops and street performances. One of the highlights of my visit was the rides. The **Transformers: The Ride** was a standout, combining cutting-edge technology with thrilling action that left me breathless. The **Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure** was another favorite, offering both excitement and a chance to cool off from the Singapore heat. For those seeking a more family-friendly experience, the **Shrek 4-D Adventure** was delightful, filled with humor and engaging visuals. The live shows were equally impressive. The **WaterWorld** stunt show was a thrilling spectacle with jaw-dropping stunts and pyrotechnics that captivated the audience. Its a must-see for anyone visiting the park! Dining options are plentiful, with various cuisines available. I enjoyed a delicious meal at Mel's Drive-In, which offered classic American fare in a retro setting. While the food was tasty, prices were a bit on the higher side, which is typical for theme parks. One thing to keep in mind is that the park can get quite crowded, especially on weekends and holidays. I recommend arriving early and considering an Express Pass to make the most of your day without long wait times. Overall, Universal Studios Singapore is a fantastic destination filled with fun, adventure, and unforgettable experiences. Whether youre a thrill-seeker or just looking to enjoy a day of entertainment, its a great choice. I left with wonderful memories and cant wait to return! Highly recommended for families and friends alike.",

Food and juices are available inside. Roller coasters have most wait times. Prayer room is also available. There can be combos offered but I think only separate dedicated trip is recommended. To reach monorail from Vivo center is most convenient way which cost 4/5 Singapore dollar. Transformers was acclaimed to be worth watching in 4d etc but after few days I found 6d experience at genting Highland which was far better. However in rides, universal studios is far superior to genting Highland. Overall it's a wonderful experience and also costly but it's only once a while and worth it.",

My wife and I spent a full day here, and it was hands down one of the most exhilarating experiences of our trip. We made it a mission to try all the rides, and each one was a unique adventure. The Battlestar Galactica roller coasters, both Human and Cylon, were pure adrenaline rushesfast, intense, and unforgettable. The Transformers 3D Ride was another standout, immersing us in a thrilling battle with incredible visuals and effects that made us feel like we were part of the action. For fans of Jurassic Park, the Water Rapids Adventure was a perfect mix of excitement and splashes. We also couldnt resist the charm of the Revenge of the Mummy, a dark, high-speed indoor coaster with a spooky yet fun vibe. Even the gentler rides, like Madagascar: A Crate Adventure, had us smiling ear to ear with their attention to detail and charm. The park itself is wonderfully designed, with each themed zonefrom Ancient Egypt to Hollywoodtransporting you to another world. The food options were diverse and delicious, and we appreciated the shaded areas and water fountains to stay cool in the tropical heat. The staff were friendly and efficient, ensuring that queues moved smoothly and adding to the overall positive vibe. While the tickets are a bit on the expensive side, the value you get from the rides, shows, and immersive experiences makes it totally worth it. Universal Studios Singapore is not just a theme parkits an unforgettable journey filled with fun, thrills, and a touch of magic. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Singapore!",

I recommend wearing a hat or using an umbrella because of the sun and heat There is a fast pass feature for events and no waiting in queues, and it is added to the admission ticket, but I recommend purchasing the regular ticket (one time admission ticket) only because it was not crowded at my time. Its price is 83 Singapore dollars. Then, if you enter and see there is crowding, you can add the express pass feature and the addition price is 100 Singapore dollars from the guest service office inside the city and do not go to the office outside.",

On the plus side, we managed to not have a lot of people so there weren't any long queues. We liked the Jurassic Park queue the most, we managed to go down it twice, we came out all wet. I bought tickets on the website, it was about PLN 500 for two tickets for one day. In the park you can watch Water World live, it's another must-see in this park. You can find a large gastronomic offer, there is a Starbucks where we went to cool off and have a drink, because it was terribly hot. I recommend visiting the Universal Studio store, you can find great souvenirs there, I bought a magnet there for 10 Singapore. The prices are high but it's like in all such places. In general, I highly recommend visiting this place, but you need at least 2 days to visit everything calmly. A minion zone is being built in the park, but from what I saw, the opening is planned for 2025",

We stayed here until 7.30pm and found it a hectic yet enjoyable day, we completed all the rides we wanted (which was most of them), we came here on Christmas Eve and the most time we had to wait for a ride was 1 hour, we just tried to go on the busier rides when shows were on to avoid big cues. The transformers ride was extremely busy but a must do and seeing the water world show was a highlight too!!! When it comes to the food, we found the food to not be the best and obviously expensive, we got some burgers from Mels Drive In, they were quite mediocre.

I recommend getting a fast pass. You'll wait much less time at activities. Especially children get bored while waiting. Fast pass provides an advantage. Rollercosters are a lot of fun. The adrenaline level of the black one is very high. We went in the afternoon. The fast pass was sufficient for all activities from 2 o'clock until closing. If you want to travel comfortably, relax and do the activities we love over and over again, go in the morning. Otherwise, 6 hours is enough for everything. I draw particular attention to the Waterworld show. It happens twice. Be sure to check out the watches and don't miss it.",

                  "review_text": "The first thing I would say is that you shouldn't bring expensive bags! I either put it in a locker when I get on a ride, or I put it on a shelf right before I get on a ride, and it's safe because it's safe, but everyone puts their Chanel bags on the shelf and rides... Well, I guess it's because it's safe that it's okay! ! I bought my ticket at Agoda the day before, and although there are buses available, I chose the monorail. I went to have breakfast at the mall near the monorail station! Meals in the park are park prices, but they are memorable so if you like them, go for it! It's hot, so if you don't want to buy drinks inside, I think it's better to bring some with you! It's a long time, from 10:00 to 20:00, but since many people stop by on the day they're heading back to the airport and leave early, it surprisingly starts to become empty in the evening. I was so excited that I decided to stay forever! Halfway through, the wait for the roller coaster series suddenly became 5 minutes, and I got carried away by riding the red Human (regular coaster), the black Cylon (twirl), and then I got drunk after twirling around Jurassic Park ( ;;) I rode most of the way, so I got home at 7pm. It's basically a small space, so I recommend checking the app to see if there are any open spaces. It was empty in the evening, so I skipped the 30 minute wait. There is no signboard that lets you see all the waiting times in the park, so you just have to look at the app. Most of the shoes I wear are foot bras, so if you don't want to have to take off your removable shoes every time you ride an attraction, I think sneakers are the way to go. Jurassic Park It's hot, so if it's empty, you should go first and get wet before walking around the park! You can bring your luggage with you, but there are lockers available for a fee. (Coaster-type trains do not force you to bring your luggage, so the coaster-type lockers are basically free. Japanese is OK. Please take your time and read carefully.) Some people brought raincoats or bought raincoats, but with a maximum of 9 people on board, there is a high possibility that 2 of them will get soaked! It's a gamble whether you use a kappa or not! ! I returned to the hotel with wet shoes, so I wish I had gotten on the train earlier. Jurassic leg bra guy Single is early! I got the best view of the scenery! Mommy It's early for singles, but I got lost on the way to the boarding area and was so scared that I almost cried.I hit it off with another child who also got lost and went to the boarding area together...When it's empty, I try not to get lost until I get to the boarding area (maybe it's just me). Personally, it's my favorite vehicle. Human Cylon It's not that scary, and the scenery isn't all that great. It's fun, but it's just a normal coaster. Shrek Zone coaster type I thought it was a trick for children, but it was surprisingly tall and scary! Visuals Donkey Shrek I'm not good at English, so I felt like I couldn't keep up with it... Shrek 4D is quite shaky, so please be careful with your children. (There are also seats that do not shake.) Sesame Street Super safe rides Water World If you don't want to get wet, please go to the back! (Surprisingly, if you look closely, there are empty seats.) I think it's more like the opening act before the show starts, so I think it's fun to go early, but I think some kids got scared because people were falling. Personally, if you don't mind, you should definitely see it! The one on fire there is a possibility of getting wet in the front row on the far right Impressed by the image in the back I've used the Single Rider several times, and every time I've been talked to, I've gotten a pack from a Korean girl I became friends with after getting lost at Mummy, a woman told me \"this is my first coaster ride in my life,\" a Chinese lady told me how beautiful the sky was, and I thought it was the most peaceful uni in the world. The vehicles and souvenirs are completely different from Los Angeles! It was so much fun! ! Minion will also be open from next week, and although the rides may be a bit old-fashioned, I definitely recommend it when you come to Singapore.",

Although some outdoor rides were closed due to weather conditions for safety reasons, we still had a fantastic time enjoying the indoor attractions. The wait times were longer than usual, but the rides and experiences were absolutely worth it. The energy of the park, the friendly staff, and the well-designed themed areas made the day extra special. Overall, Universal Studios Singapore continues to be a must-visit destination.

It's a fantastic spot for kids and adults alike to let loose, have fun, and create unforgettable memories. Visit the Minion Mart to shop for your favourite Plush toys, apparel, collectibles and etc. Good to book your ticket one day in advance on Resorts World website. Go early to avoid the crowd.

However, dont forget to bring a rain cover even for your shoes! Getting caught in sudden rain or a storm is quite common. You can easily spend long hours here, a couple of hours is definitely not enough, as there are so many attractions to watch and participate in. If theres a special event, they might close early without prior notice, so its best to visit earlier in the day to make the most of your experience. Its not just for kids! The visual shows and theater performances are incredibly vibrant. Even if youre prone to dizziness, you should still experience Sci-Fi City; the rides there felt unbelievably realistic. The film sets and recreations were simply stunning. With seven different themed zones, we only managed to explore a few, but every part of it was absolutely worth it!",

The place is included with a lot of adventure activities. Some activities carry the history of many places around the world and some activities are related to science fiction. All of these are made by artificial things, not from natural things. Inside here many food, coffee and ice cream shops are also presented. The prices are also similar to the outside.",

Tickets were about 15,000 yen per person for the Univa and Night Safari pack from the Klook site. No matter how many times I tried, I couldn't get the QR code from the voucher, so I had a hard time, so I asked the hotel front desk to do it for me. It was quite troublesome. Use the MRT to get to UNIVA, and Singapore has a well-developed transportation network that is easy to understand, convenient, and fast. And you can go there safely and securely. And everyone is kind. After arriving at Univa, I was able to easily go around the attractions in about 2 hours and ride the attractions without waiting. Being in a subtropical region, I was physically exhausted from all the hard walking, so I decided to return home after about 3 hours. It's disappointing and expensive compared to Universal in Japan, but it was a great memory of my trip.",

There aren't many rides that you can ride because it takes too long to take photos. Finding a spot is a bit tricky. So there were only about 10 rides to ride. But I've ridden all the best rides. Most like Battlestar Galactica! There are also cool ones like Transformers the Ride, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure which gets wet, lights, camera, action are also really cool, there is a mummy rollercoaster too. And other rides that I haven't had the chance to ride yet. It is recommended to come from 10 am in the morning so you can enjoy all the rides!

The attractions are nice. 1] There could be queues at some attractions, but they have an app which indicates the queue length at each attraction. 2] There are three huge roller coasters are one of the topmost attractions there. One larger than the other kinds. 3] There are rides like Transformers which are kind of virtual roller coaster rides and it is one of the top most attraction apart from roller coaster. 4] There are many rides like Puss in the boots which are for smaller kids 5] They also have 2-3 shows which are basically live and are arranged for only twice a day and run for 45 mins in each run. Please check the timings of the show as soon as you enter to enjoy them throughly. We had seen a show of Waterworld where they performed a lot of live stunts which was amazing to see. 6] Food options are relatively limited. If you are vegetarian they are only one or two options like Biryani inside. But it is not a big problem as such. 7] There are too many things to see so make sure that you reach there on time. 8] Please check that tickets are in order. I had booked a 3 day pass through Klook or similar site and it turnout that I had to mail them Universal first and then they send the tickets. This process wasted half an hour for me. So make sure you read the passes and conditions for entry.",

Some attractions take longer than 60 minutes, so the Express Pass comes in handy at times like this For those over 60 years old, get a big discount with a senior ticket. You can get a 10% discount on all purchases within the park with your MasterCard, but be aware that some stores do not accept credit cards. My recommendation is the drink cup. If you carry it with you, you can get an additional drink for 3. It's a sturdy cup, so you can use it at home as wellIf you have an E-ticket, don't forget to print it out using the printer on the right side of the park entrance.",

Next we were there by 9.30 way before it open at 10 am... That's good as you get to analyse the crowd and the situation... But why? Because... You should make the decision to purchase the EXPRESS like we did.. It's no joke, if you're planning to come here with family with kids.. With anyone.. Be prepared to spend a minimum of 100 to 50 per person.. The price for express changes based one the demand for it.. So the earliest bird gets the cheaper but on weekends its pretty standard at 100. Why do you need to spend that amount.. Let me tell you why... If you do not want to que at every ride... Carrying kids in the sun.. While trying to finish as many.. Please buy it. We did not que at any except for one ride.. Which didn't have express... While we got express I saw parents with kids... Crying, restless.. Just waiting for literally hours.. No joke.. They waited for 2 hours for one ride.. And rides that lasted you less than 5 to 8 mins.. Can you imagine.. If you wanted to go again.. You had to line another hour or so.. Or longer.. There are two types of express.. 1 limited to just one time per ride.. And unlimited... As many times.. We got the unlimited but if its your first time that's alright.. If you think you only wanted to do everything once. Its preferences. I went for one ride 4 times as I saw the same people in line. As a couple we finished every ride.. Took us 6 hours... I guess even longer with kids.. And also.. We went to nearly ever show.. Get the map and the showtime pamphlet.. And be ready for all.. You wouldn't want to miss it.",

If you're willing to go to universal studios, reach by 9.45 and you will be done with almost all of the rides by 2 PM without an express pass. 3 ratings because as per the entry pass amount, the park isn't as big as the other ones and everything is way too over priced.",

If youre not the patient type, will advise to get the fast pass option as you will still need to wait about 60-90mins for rides like Galactica and Jurassic Park.

It is one of the must visit places in Singapore and one not to be missed by tourists. It is not only for children but people of all ages. The theme park is centralised on various movie characters. The theme park itself is super organised and the staff takes care of everything very well. Even large queues are handled well. Even with thousands visiting it every day, the place is super clean. I recommend you buy the Universal Express Pass if you want to do all the rides in one day. It costs S40. It may seem to be a lot but is integral if you want to finish all the rides as the queues for some rides maybe more than an hour long. There are a number of shows at different timings and one of the best being Water World (right next to Jurassic Park). You can even meet the characters and click pictures with them. My favourite rides include the Grey track rollercoaster, The mummy rollercoaster and the Jurassic Park Boat ride. All in all, it will be a day of fun and one which you will always remember.",

It's a little hard to see, but if you go to the right side, the staff will be standing there, so look for them. The basic screaming machine will leave all your luggage (including your smartphone) in a locker. You will be checked with a metal detector at the entrance to the vehicle. If you cannot return within the specified time, you will be charged a fee, so it is a good idea to have a credit card or banknotes with you. Even if you get on the train without carrying anything and have to pay, the staff will pay for your locker, so please talk to the staff near your locker. The garden is very compact, so I was able to move around without getting tired. Also, I was prepared for it to be as crowded as USJ, but I was able to ride the ride in about 10 to 30 minutes, and I was able to enjoy it while taking a relaxing break. On the way back, I took the train one stop away and enjoyed shopping as there was a shopping mall at the station.",

If you are travelling with a group try and get the express pass as it would save you A LOT of time. If you are travelling alone it is fast as you can take the single line in most of the rides. It can get pretty hot so you can take a cap with you. Some rides also get you slightly wet, but not a big deal. There are drying pods if you need to use them. The best rides are the two main roller coasters Battlestar Galactica, do those first as they are the most awesome rides in the park. Next go for the transformers, revenge of the mummy, Jurassic park rapid adventures, Shrek 4d. There is a cool show at the water word section too. You have to place bags in locker for certain rides. So think about that if your bags are huge. There are cafes and merchandise shops all over the park as well as portable water. This was an amazing experience and would definitely come again.",

If you are single or willing to split up on rides, you can finish it early. They should allow this option on all the rides. Lots of photo ops everywhere. Kids will definitely enjoy. For adults there are fewer exciting rides, with lots of waiting. They don't allow photography on any ride for safety. That's good. But with appropriate mount for action cams they should.",

Also, the car game is a beautiful experience that makes you come back to try it and enjoy it and yourself will come back to try it. The most important thing is that the ticket is in the highest category so that you can enjoy others, as you will get tired of waiting Because it is sometimes crowded as you can imagine",

The passes are valid for a few days since time of booking. So you can get them in advance. Each ride has a counter at the entrance telling you the waiting period for the same. Start your day early in the morning so you have less waiting period for each ride. Eateries inside have mainly non vegetarian food. But right near the Transformers, there is a STAR-BOT Cafe....you will get 100% vegetarian food there. And huge bowls of it. Trust me, you won't leave disappointed. Roadside hawkers are also located every few blocks. Big rides like Battlestar Gallactica will take easily about 1hour to await your turn. Plan your day accordingly. Water rides are also amazing and must do.",

Sometimes the general channel queues for 2 hours, single people only need to queue for 15 minutes. You can put it before playing mummy and red and blue roller coaster Bags are stored in the lockers, which is very convenient! There are free storage hours, and you will be charged if you exceed the time limit (so remember to bring some cash with you) Try not to bring anything with you when you are waiting for the roller coaster, including your mobile phone! Dont bring it! It will fall off the staff will check it for you before queuing up Recommended food in the park: turkey legs (really huge). The gourmet restaurants in the park are all the same, it depends on what style you want to eat. There is a restaurant in Lost World with a giraffe outside. The fried stick legs inside are OK! If you dont like the restaurants in the park, you can go to the exit to get a park stamp, and then come back in to play after youve eaten enough! Recommended parent-child itinerary: No1-Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Station No2-4D Shrek No3-Madagascar No.4-Jurassic River Adventure No5-The Adventures of the Invincible Cat Swordsman No6-Charizard Flight School After leaving the gate, go right to the seawall steps, facing vivo city. There is a 15-minute free crane ballet water dance show at 8:00 every night. You can watch it! Very exciting The light rail express on Vivo city 3F only charges once when you go there. There is no charge from Sentosa to other stations or back to vivo city. By-walking around the world is like walking through the kitchen at home, people who go there every day to play a round",

We queued for our first ride: Transformer. 30 mins into the queue, the ride broke down (We encounter power failure while in the queue). Turn out a few rides were affected (Transformer, the Mummy, Jurassic Park rapid adventure and Madagascar crate adventure). So the crowd dispersed and concentrate on other rides making the the queue to balloon to 60 mins or more. Due to covid19, most rides have their capacities reduced by half (they kept alternate row empty for social distancing). Again, this contribute to the longer queue. On hindsight, the best decision I made today: I purchased unlimited express pass for myself and my 2 kids. Instead of queuing for 60 mins, I get to ride 3 different rides in 1 hour. Some rides, I get to ride multiple times. Those downed rides went back up after 2 hours or so (Transformer went down again later in the evening). I noticed the crowds were getting lesser after 6pm. Most likely because most people went for dinner or went home. This is the best timing for getting on rides if you dont have express pass. The rides are open from 2pm to 9pm. I would have rated my experience 2 stars without the unlimited express pass. It seriously worth the splurge.",

Definitely worth it as we were able to cover more attractions. F&B: Most restaurants and cafes were open with only a few closed. There are at least 2-3 Halal restaurants open during this period. Facilities: Free lockers available to store personal items during the ride. Musollah for Muslim guests is closed during this period, thus remember to bring your own prayer mats. Overall, experience was great and crowd was on par during pre Covid days. Social Distancing Ambassadors are around to advise guests and can be seen almost everywhere. The only disappointment is the temporary closure of shows due to Covid-19 measures.",

Thereafter we decided to purchase the Express Pass which is priced almost the same as the entry ticket. With the Express tickets, the longest wait is about 20 mins, and the fastest was no queue required for the Express lane at Transformer 4D.

Go for transformers first if you dont have roller coaster experience. It will be definitely awesome. Then revenge of the mummy is indoor coaster in dark chill environment. Other than coaster thrill nothing much actually. Battlestar galactica coasters both will give you an experience that you wont forget for life. Both humans and cylons equally great. Human coaster is fast and more gravity drops than cylons. Cylons are more about inversion, but its not that scary coz speed cancels out the gravity. So dont miss that too. Express pass recommended if you dont want to wait. I went on a weekend and I didnt wait in queue for any rides. Express line is virtually empty. Queue length and wait time is huge in normal line. Try to reach 30 mins earlier before park rides opens. You will be allowed inside. Can stroll around and get to know the park before starting. 4 star coz some of the rides and shows are cancelled.",

It was a bit costly but well worth it. We got included souvenirs, dining credits, and Express Unlimited cards for after the tour. The best part we had a guide take us around the park wherever we wanted to go and he took us too all the rides up from the exits. We went straight in, zero waiting, ahead of the lines including the Express line. This was great. We could pick the front row or wherever we wanted. We could do multiple times, etc. Some lines had an 80 minute wait. We had none. Again expensive but worth it. Additionally our guide scheduled photo opportunity with Transformers and we were first in line and no wait for Megatron. Funny as a decepticon he was complaining to us the whole time. Good fun. All in all it was hot and humid but moving quickly through the park was super helpful and nice.",

I don't know for how long, but now even you have to tap your EZLink card, the price is 0 SGD. 3. Go in early, get out late. Maximize your time. 4. Always purchase the souvenirs for at least at 5 pm (2 hours before closing). There will be a long queue if you go at closing time. You cannot freely choose to buy anything. 5. Buy at the Universal Souvenir Shop (next to HelloKitty Store). It is the only place that contains all of the characters. 6. Take photo in the Alley next to the Mel's Restaurant. It have a lot of unique photo spots. Also check when the lights goes on. You will have a bit different ambience of the photos. 7. There will be some closed/under renovations Attractions. If you purchase the standart Express pass, you will be eligible to ride the same attractions more than 1 time if you choose.",

At noon, you should take the train to Vivo City to eat because there are many options with more affordable prices. You need to keep your ticket, and get it stamped at the gate to be able to re-enter. Overall, I had a great experience here.",

If you wait in line and ride it once, it's closing time, so ride it once without waiting in line and take a look around and buy a souvenir before leaving. The rides are fun enough, but the price is a bit expensive. Unless you feel catharsis from standing in line, get the express. The egg character t-shirts at the souvenir shop are cute.",

The line is quite fast. The scale felt the same or smaller than Lotte World. Because it is a franchise, the prices are quite expensive. If you don't go there just to ride the rides, people who like taking pictures or who like the universal world view will likely enjoy it. Even though it was a weekday, there were a lot of people. Depending on popularity without Express Pass, the wait can be as short as 30 minutes or as long as 2 hours. I was the worst because I didn't like waiting in line. The restaurants in the theme park are packed with people trying to order, and the prices are much higher than Singapore prices, so I recommend eating a good meal before entering the USS. For simple food and beverages sold at stands, the waiting line is long and stock runs out early. There is a card reader, but is it broken? There are many places that only accept cash. In conclusion, I think visiting once is enough.",

Otherwise, in Singapores weather, you will have to queue for several hours for each item and then the game will end in 1 to 3 minutes. There is really no experience at all. Although priority tickets are expensive, without priority tickets, it is almost impossible to experience most of Universal Studios' projects in one day, especially on weekends and holidays. Relatively speaking, the two types of priority tickets can only be used once for all items (except for a few). The unlimited priority tickets are not necessary unless you particularly love one of the items. The Battlestar Coaster is definitely the flagship of all the roller coaster projects at Universal Studios. If there are no health risks, this project is 100% recommended to experience. Of course, this project is also one of the projects with the largest queues (there is also a project with a large number of people queuing for Jurassic World Ride, which I personally think is very average). There is a sister roller coaster next to this roller coaster (red track), which has a lower difficulty level (no 360-degree rotation). Friends who want to ride a roller coaster but are afraid of it can experience this roller coaster first, and then consider whether to go to the Ace Coaster for fun. There is the only Starbucks not far from the entrance of the park. The other restaurants in the park can only be said to be quite satisfactory. The taste and price are not far different from those outside the scenic area. At least it is enough to satisfy your appetite. Compared with the catering in a certain country's scenic area, it is simply too conscientious. Compared with Universal Studios in other countries, the projects are single and the area is much smaller. It is also unbelievable that some products, including the parks sales stores, are out of stock. However, Universal Studios Singapore is still highly recommended as one of the must-see attractions when traveling to New Zealand. Finally, I reiterate that priority tickets are really worth buying if you want to really play. Finally, I wish you (we) have fun!",

Rides started sharp at 12 noon. Waiting time for express pass holders was less than 10 minutes on any given point of the day on any eligible ride. We went on Transformers, Cylon, Human, Mummy and Jurrasic water ride atleast 4 times during whole day. Lunch @ Louis NY pizza was good . They have a combo of Pizza, Drink and dessert which is quite filling for 1 person. Lots of snack options available through out the park Staff is courteous and follows rules.

As of early October 22 Highly recommended Mummy Transformers highly recommended Battlestar Galactica is human? Cyclone was much more fun than that. I rode in the front row and the back row, and both were fun hahaha. Jurassic Park is under construction, so its a flume ride? I didn't enjoy it. Shrek is just not that good?

Dont buy universal fast pass unless you feel the need of it and youre time constrained. Assess the crowd and you can always buy it inside the park based on crowd. 2. Be first to finish the highlight attractions like transformers and Jurassic world as crowd gets thicker as the day grows. 3. Didnt find much benefit in the Christmas meal voucher, so please avoid it. Buy just a entrance ticket and buy food of choice without getting restricted with voucher. 4. Have entire day planned so that you have the time to enjoy., if you are allocating only half day you might rush and miss few attractions. 5. Try to get the photo time from transformers and jurassaic characters (they have posted the time in front of the attraction) 6. Have fun with the rides and with many photo opportunities.",

If it rains all the outdoor rides are closed then only 3 rides are available inside. Rest are show. There are only 4 rides which you must try here is Transformers Battlestar Galactica Human Battlestar Galactica Cyclone. Mummy Ride. No money is refunded if the ride is suspended.

We pre booked the tickets in advance to avoid any delays in the queue and we were glad we did. It saved us quite some time. As soon as we enter, the whole atmosphere changes. It is recommended to buy Universal express pass to avoid the hour long queues for each and every theme ride. There are 2 types of passes one is of 60 and another is of 90. The first pass allows a person take each ride only once but the later allows unlimited rides which I regret that I didnt take. Each and every ride is awesome and gives wonderful experience. Among those rides Transformers theme and Mummy theme rides will give you goosebumps. We have locker services provided before we get on few rides so we dont loose our stuff during the ride. Overall it was a wonderful experience to have.",

So, if you want to experience USS fully, I suggest you to buy the express pass. There are 2 kinds of express passes, but for me, Universal Express Day Pass is more than enough.

Unfortunately, few attractions were closed (Pussinboots, Waterworld, kids climbing, madagascar ... and other zones in construction). You book online, and they don't tell you about the closure ... I was really looking forward to doing the Waterworld show ... the daily pass shall be pro-rated or refundable in case of fewer attractions. Luckily, the park is very small so you can move quickly in it. I think it is not worth taking the Unlimited Express. Just the regular one will be ok as the parc is only open 11am to 6pm ... you won't have time to do more than 1 time each ride even with express ... The park a s bit aging. Maybe it is a post covid lack of maintenance. Staff is smiling but not super enthusiastic for the majority. Overall, it is ok, but I think it is not worth 550SGD day passes express unlimited (2 adults 1 child) for the day ... I'm giving it a 3 star, but a 2.5 would be more adequate as the experience was very average.",

The rides itself were really exciting and fun. For many rides, you need to put your bags in lockers, at first I felt uncomfortable putting my phone and money etc in the lockers, but all went well.

Ticket prices are premium so even if taken from any sites like Klook etc would not make any difference. For Indians, ticket prices from Klook, with admission express, will be around 9,500 per person which as per Singapore standards is reasonable. Plan to buy tickets in advance. The queues at the spot are very long. Arrive 20 minutes before the starting time and skip long entry queues by showing your express pass at the entry counter. Try to complete either Jurassic ride or Mummy returns first. There will be no queue when the park opens. Later even the express queues get long and would be at least 30 mins of waiting. There are a few rides like Treasure Hunt (Ancient Egypt) and Jurassic Canopy rides that don't have express entrance but are in demand. If you are with a kid, you may want to spend some time during peak afternoon time at Far Far Away land and see some of the shows. Remember to carry Umbrellas and Sunglasses. By 4 30 pm, the queues we saw were less in Express and hence could visit Transformers ride almost with no queue in express. Overall, an okay experience. Nothing great if you have visited the LA Universal Studio. SG Universal Studio is a smaller, compact entertainment park. We didn't see any angry crew. In fact, all the staff were very friendly and helped in answering queries on directions. Tips 1. Do not visit without the Express Pass 2. Carry Sunglasses, umbrellas 3. Jurassic ride you will get wet. 4. Canopy rides in Jurassic, Puss n Boots, enhancement airways can be a bit scary for kids , but is okay for adults. 5. Mummy returns is a must scary ride 6. All rides are about 1 min max 7. Lights Action Camera, New York ride, Shrek 4D are okay for small kids too. 8. Staff are friendly. Ps: photo shows the rush for Mummy returns in the express lane. About 30 mins waiting at around 1 pm.",

I bought a fast track bracelet for my family for all the games and I was surprised that there are games that do not include fast track. In one of the games I asked an employee on the fast track because the track board was not clear, unfortunately. He put me in a queue where I sat for an hour, and it turned out that the employee had racial fanaticism and deliberately put me in the wrong lane and did not put me in the express entry lane. There is poor regulation of express entry, meaning that There is a card that you buy to enter some games, fast entry, and this is the reason for its crowding and the lack of clarity about those who have the fast entry bracelet from the card. There is chaos, some of them enter the fast lane without having a card or bracelet, and they enter the game without any supervision from the organizers. 2- I also bought an express entry card for offers, although it was previously part of the express entry bracelet, but they separated it. Unfortunately, its price was very expensive, and entry was poorly organized because they were sorting people outside, but inside the hall the situation was chaotic. You would find everyone sitting in the express entry area, so I absolutely do not recommend buying it. Come ten minutes before the show and after you enter because there are no organizers inside, sit in the front where those who have... Express entry cards. 3- Previously, the studio opened at 10 p.m. and closed at 7 p.m., meaning (9 hours) and at an acceptable price, but now it opens at 11 a.m. and closes at 6 p.m., meaning (7 hours), at a high price, and a third of the studios games are closed. 4- It was a very bad experience and I was disappointed in Universal Studio due to the chaos, the negligence of the organizers inside, the restoration work, and the high prices. I do not advise anyone to visit it due to the presence of restoration work, as well as the presence of restoration work on Sentosa Island, and many of the events that were free on the island have become expensive and have become Concern is money, not tourist entertainment.",

Ensure you visit on a weekday, like Thursday and be right on time before the opening time, and the trick is to avoid entering the rides near the entrance first. Start with those in the back or the ones with high demand, such as the Transformers ride. In the evening, the rides near the entrance are always empty, so that's the perfect time to go there. Use the Universal Studios app to check wait times and navigate accordingly, rather than following a set order. Mark down the meet and greet times and spots to arrive right on time. The roller coasters are worth it, and lockers are free for a duration of around 30-40 minutes. We checked roller coaster wait times, selected lockers, finished the ride, switched lockers, and went to the next ride, so we didn't pay for lockers at all. If you still lack time you can skip the enchanted airways and magic potion spin which looks less exciting after riding the main roller coaster rides. Yes, the food and drinks are expensive, but having a big breakfast outside and the motivation to try all the rides meant we barely felt hungry, so we didn't dine there at all. You can take water inside, so no need to buy their overpriced water and drinks. All the rides and shows were excellent, providing a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Buy the tickets online in a site like Klook which is cheaper.",

The entertainments vary from the highest adrenaline-seeking to your family-friendly comedy shows. Pictures! Pictures could be taken anywhere especially with the merchandises that you could buy there. Now, on to the critiques and advices. Of course, every place has its flaws and these reviews are here to help build it for the better First of all, the queues. The queues will take you 15-60 minutes for only about 5 minutes of entertainment. That's why I would HIGHLY recommend getting the express ticket. You could upgrade your regular ticket to an express in the ticket booth up front. It is pricy at first sight, but the amount of rides you could experience and the amount of time you save is worth it. But note that not all rides accept express in the way that you need to wait as of the others. I would recommend bringing a change of clothes as it would often get hot, you'd get wet while riding a ride. In my case, I forgot to bring an extra change, so I had to buy one _. Last but not least, bring your family, friends, wife or husband, relatives, and so on. They will make the trip even better. That is all. Enjoy uss",

You can check the waiting time on the official app, but it doesn't match the current situation. On Mummy's Ride, it says that you have to put your personal belongings in a coin locker (if you wait 15 minutes, 45 minutes are free), but since the waiting time was much longer than the displayed wait time, we ended up having to pay. What do you do when your wallet is in the coin locker? ? ? It was very crowded and I had to call a staff member to open the paid lockers, which surprised me at how inefficient it was. The guidebook said it was cashless only, but there were some places that didn't accept Amex, so I ended up paying in cash. At restaurants, there are too many people occupying tables and taking breaks without eating, resulting in unnecessary waiting time. It was the worst dining experience because the cast members were unmotivated and didn't pay attention or consideration. If you don't have an express pass, you'll have to wait in line for the attractions, but I don't think it's necessary to buy a pass. For families with children, it can be quite tiring not to have easy rides where you can ride without waiting.",

Some key points: To make the the most of your day, you gotta get Universal Express. Trust me, some queues get up to a 90-minute wait. It's steep but worth it. The Universal Express Pass works only once per ride. So best to plan your day before heading to Sentosa (where Universal Studios is). If you're there as soon as gates open at 10am, you could get the first two rides without any queues to worry about, so you save your Universal Express Pass to return to those rides and jump the queue when the wait times are over 40 minutes. I recommend getting in at 10am and going straight to Battlestar Galactica Human and Battlestar Galactica Cylon using regular queue. These rides are really good and you're gonna wanna do these again. By the time you're done with the first two rides, the queues would be getting longer so you can now use your Express Pass for the rest of the day (and be sure to return to those first two rides and enjoy the quick Universal Express access). The best rides for me are Battlestar Galactica: Cylon, Battlestar Galactica: Human, Transformers The Ride and the Mummy Ride. Jurassic Park is good too, but best to do that at the end of your day because you will get wet even with the silly little plastic coat thing they sell there. The Waterworld show is also quite good. There are heaps on eating options at Universal Studios. I didn't like the corn dogs but the hot dogs near Jurassic Park were fantastic. I highly recommend it. The Thai Basil hotdog is divine and the staff member there - Yusri, was great. Staff wise: it's a bit of a mixed bag. Some rude attendants are polite and fun. Others are robotic and often not in the best of moods. Getting there is quite easy. Beware of a bit of surge pricing when taking a taxi from Sentosa to return to your hotel. Enjoy.",

Usually when we visit USS, it is also a staycation in RWS, and so we will usually exit during lunch time, maybe go back to the room to rest and escape from the afternoon sun and come back again after 3pm. No re-entry means lunch was inside USS. As it is the school holidays, the place is quite crowded and due to the rain, everyone was indoors. As a gauge, a burger and fries set is 17 and a corn dog is 7, and a scope of ice cream is 7. 2. Universal express pass is limited. If you do not wish to wait in queue for rides (as a gauge, Rapid dash was 50 mins queue, transformer ride was 60 mins and Puss-in-boots ride was 40 mins wait), the express pass is an option. It cost about 90 for a person, but from the beginning of the year, they no longer offer unlimited express pass. The express pass can only be used once at every attraction. For example if you are not intending to use the pass for the enchanted airways ride, it cannot be used for a 2nd express ride for transformer ride. With minion land still under construction, Dino soarin also not available, there were less rides available, we were hoping that we can do a few more rounds with other rides. The forum area at RWS is under renovation and many food options closed due to new development in RWS, perhaps it will be better to come again when all the development is done.",

Its just a nasty way to mark up all prices by 10%. If you think popcorn is expensive at the movie theatre. Then do not even think about buying it here. 10 bucks for a tiny thing that is filled to 75% because the top is supposed to be able to be folded and closed... well thats a rip off too.

One of the photos I had taken earlier in the day didnt turn out as nice as I had hoped, and without hesitation, Iskandar kindly offered to help me retake it. He was incredibly patient and meticulous, putting in extra effort to ensure the new photo was perfect. His dedication to ensuring I wouldnt leave with a less-than-stellar memento was genuinely heartwarming. Its rare to encounter someone so committed to delivering top-notch service, and Iskandars attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile truly made my day.

My suggestion is buy yourself an express pass if you love rides and do not want to miss any one. I finished all the rides and did some, multiple times.

The park puts a lot of focus on sesame Street, which i found very different, but in a good way. The park runs a wonderful scam called express pass. They really market the product well BUT out of the couple dozen rides at the park available to ride, the express pass provides redeamable express opportunity for approximately 6 or so rides and the price is disgustingly high. A little known fact is that universal singapore is the only universal franchise in the globe. The Singapore universal studios are owned by a private company called resorts world sentosa. This is reflected in the crazy bits and pieces you come across throughout your day - example:, no drink lids available for your drinks, no salt in the food outlets accessible to patrons, no paper copy express passes etc i could go on, however it just reflects and highlights the cost cutting going on, by the private company, at the expense of the customer experience. This in turn, has you worried about the maintenance that is occurring behind the scenes. To that end, as you go around the Jurassic park water ride you tend to see some broken dinosours that haven't been fixed or maybe haven't been noticed. In any case, this was another example of cost cutting at resorts world sentosa. Would I consider going with the family again......not anytime soon. With the exception of mi ions land, the rest of the park has been the same for almost 2 decades and is starting to feel it.",

By early morning at 10 am and after 4 pm anyways waiting times are less than 20 minutes for most rides. (There are hardly many key rides there) IMO Express pass is not needed (not worth it), if you feel the need, you can still buy it inside the USS after entering the park. Book the tickets in advance from Klook or other platforms to get the good discounted rates.",

Pretty expensive and 20-40 minutes wait for all the kids rides but not enough rides available for little kids to want to upgrade to the express tickets. Definitely worth upgrading if it was just me! Meet and greets with characters was well organised and easy to figure out. Would recommend downloading the app to plan your schedule before going if you want to see the shows etc. It was fun despite everything being the same as I last went 8 years ago haha.",

On arrival my girlfriend and I tried to enter the main entrance but were directed to a 'VIP' lounge which was a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately my delight abruptly dissolved when we walked into the 'VIP lounge' as it resembled a kindergarten with screaming kids and stressed-looking parents everywhere. We were greeted by staff who looked like they were forcing a smile upon their faces and given a cold drink. I then had a 'terms and conditions' document thrust in front of me to sign, as the staff member used her finger to highlight and verbally describe that it was not a private tour and that we would be with 12 other people with no mention of children. As I looked around the chaotic child-filled room I instantly realised that I'd been had. I calmly pointed out that I did not spend over GBP500 to spend the day with screaming children and that their literature had not indicated such information. I then spent the next 15 minutes speaking to three different members of staff whose seniority went up when the last one failed to appease me. I ended up speaking to a female manager of some sort who essentially accused me of discriminating against children. For a manager or supervisor overseeing a VIP team I was quite shocked to hear the word 'discriminate' in the context of our conversation. It is a very provocative word and to use in these circumstances showed extremely poor judgement and an attitude which suggested that I had somehow committed an offence for expecting a VIP tour to be with adults. Clearly there is an ongoing issue with what the Universal Studios literature and advertising suggests in order to raise your expectations of how the tour will be conducted because if there was not, why are the staff at pains to only point out that you will be with 12 other 'participants' on the VIP tour but not highlight anything else? I think if Universal Studios (US) uses clear advertising to suggest that US is for adults as well as children, which it does, I think it is perfectly reasonable to make it clear that when you take a VIP tour, you are very likely to spend the day with up to 10 children and parents. However according to the VIP Team supervisor, this would be discrimination! I think perhaps Universal Studios should give their staff more training on communication skills and using non-provocative language if in fact the individual knows the true meaning of the word in the first place. After this distasteful experience, our VIP Tour guide for the day was absolutely fabulous and really knew how to salvage the day for us. In conclusion, I would not recommend the VIP tour unless you are happy to spend the day with children. Otherwise we had a good day.",

Waste of money The Human and Cyclone that are worth riding have to be left in a locker because you can't have any luggage. It's free for 45 minutes, but if even 1 minute passes, you'll be charged 4. I paid the money after 4 minutes... ha... The safety device was covered in soggy sweat that I almost vomited.

From the moment I stepped in, the excitement was non-stop and the best part? I managed to enjoy all the major rides without needing an Express Pass. Heres what worked for me: Arrive Early: The park opens at 10:00 AM I reached by 9:30 AM and was among the first to enter. I went straight to the popular rides like Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy, and Jurassic Park Rapids and avoided long queues. Plan Your Route: Cover the thrill rides first before the crowds build up, then move to the family and indoor attractions post-lunch. No Express Pass Needed: With early entry and a bit of planning, I skipped all the long lines and saved money. Collect Your Birthday Gift: Dont forget to stop by the Visitor Centre near the entrance. Just show a valid ID and collect a special birthday badge and a gift voucher (mine included retail discounts and a free souvenir)! Stay Hydrated & Take Breaks: Singapore weather can be humid. Use the shaded areas and indoor shows (like WaterWorld or Shrek 4D) as fun breaks between rides. Use the Official App: It helps with live wait times, show schedules, and maps super handy for staying ahead. Whether it's your birthday or not, Universal Studios Singapore is a blast but with a bit of strategy, it becomes even more enjoyable and stress-free. Highly recommended!",

Its way less crowded and much more enjoyable. Arrive when the park opens. We went on a weekday during a non-peak season , early in the day, wait times were about 1530 minutes, but later in the afternoon, most rides were only 5 minutes. We got to enjoy everything and even did some rides more than once! Avoid peak periods if possible. During busy times, youll end up waiting in long lines under the heat and humidity. Ticket prices for adults start from SGD 62 (depending on the website and promotions). Check the official Resorts World Sentosa website for the most accurate price. Express Pass info: Universal Express: Starts from SGD 90 per person. Lets you skip the queue once per ride. Universal Express Plus: Starts from SGD 120 per person. Lets you skip the queue as many times as you want on each ride. (Both are only valid on the day of your visit) My advice: If youre going on a weekday and outside of peak season, you probably dont need the Express Pass, the lines are short enough, and youll save money!",

Not too many special effects; just some fancy costumes. Make sure you get some pictures with Marilyn Monroe ;) I'm a total rollercoaster fanatic and the twin roller coaster rides were FANTASTIC! I also did the transformers ride (not really a rollercoaster) which was also quite special but not as intense. Hat tip to the mummy ride. On of the best I have ever done. Luckily I visited universal on a weekday and the off peak season so queues were minimal and wait times were very low too. Otherwise I heard you can wait for quite a while.

The various screams from time to time make the whole atmosphere even more exciting Fortunately, I have a friend to stand in the way of all this. If there is a ghost, I will just go to him. But I was still so scared that my voice became hoarse. I said it is fun to come to the haunted house if you are afraid of ghosts. If you are not afraid, it is a waste of money.

Security checks are there, however, they are sometimes allowing dry and packed foods. You can carry a small bottle with you, so that you can fill the bottle inside the studio, as there are lots of filling taps are available. Better carry a cap or umbrella with you.",

I feel like there were more roller coasters here than in Japan. Most roller coasters at once It was an accelerating type.",

There are lots of Roller Coaster rides there, both indoor and outdoor with various levels of height, speed and track length that are a shame to miss... Apart from that, there is also a 3D museum, an aquarium with various types of sea animals, places to eat, places to buy souvenirs, cafes, and several other games, as well as interesting photo spots for those of you who want selfies or wefies with friends and family. you guys.. Don't worry about your belongings while playing there, because there are several paid storage places in the form of self-service lockers provided, but they have a time limit, so when the time is up, the locker key will automatically open by itself, but you can still extend it by Pay again at the machine, or move to another locker closest to the game you want to try next! Don't forget to provide small money to pay at the locker machine! It's best if you want to visit and try all the rides there, you have to come from the moment they open and spend your time there all day until they close again, because to try just one ride, you still have to queue long according to the time and moment you are at. come there, unless you buy a USS express ticket, you still have to queue, but not as long as the regular queue... For food, it's a good idea to bring your own from outside!! Because there are many food places there that provide food that doesn't suit our taste buds and the prices are quite expensive!!! But again, it depends on individual tastes...Hehe And one more thing, if you are interested in trying all the rides there, it would be better if you bought tickets outside the area or at the travel agent where you come from, because of course, the price will be much cheaper...",

Transformers - feel very realistic 3. Lights, Camera, Action show - we will feel there is real tsunami. 4. Jurassic Park - end is a twist 5. Galactica and cylon - these are very adventurous and recommend to the young people with no fear of heights. Overall, it is a good place to visit. Only bad part is they don't introduce new rides often. Same rides for the whole year except Halloween day show which is every year.",

(Please don't go for them if you can't handle it .. the rides are safe but might not be enjoyable for everyone) Rides: 1. BattleStar Galactica (human,cylon): This is c.r.a.z.y. Youll get flipped in every possible direction and won't be able to figure out which is sky and which is ground. At some points you'll feel like you're gonna hurtle into the crowd below but be assured that the ride was pretty safe when we were on it. They'll just strap you on and you'll think that you'll get a couple of seconds to prepare yourself but no .. :D you'll start screaming three seconds into the ride and get out of your seats at the end with jelly legs. There are two variations, try the white roller coaster (cylon) if you want a scarier ride. 2. Transformers 3D ride: This concept is so cool. For anyone who is a Transformers fan, this is a treat. Not very scary, but it's like being in visual reality. I really recommend this one, and it's not scary at all. Really enjoyable, rather, in fact I wanted to go twice. 3. Jurassic Park rapids: Low key water ride. No adrenaline rushes, you can just chill and float the whole way in a tube car. 4. Revenge of the Mummy: It's in the Ancient Egypt theme park and not as crazy as the Battlestar Galactica but nevertheless good. There's a steep drop at the end which makes it enjoyable. Other attractions include a BumbleBee danceoff (which is really cute), the Water World show at Jurassic Park The Lost World (interactive - they will get the audience wet so front row viewers beware :D), a few other rides for kids at Far Far Away and Madagascar.",

Certainly am not a hard core roller coaster rider. Riding Human after makes it fill tame. Most rides were pretty good... With the exception of Magadascar...

If you're an adrenaline junkie, you might be slightly disappointed by the number of rides catering more towards kids and families but these are still genuinely fun experiences. The highlight is definitely the twin looping coasters based on the Battlestar Galactica franchise with its high-speed launches and turns, this is one ride you'll definitely want to try at least once. Be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours during peak periods of the year unless you're willing to fork out the unlimited express pass (90) which will get you to the rides in as fast a third of the time.",

As someone who has been to Universal Orlando, its definitely not up there in terms of quality due to the lack of area available, but I love this theme park. Every time I come to Singapore, this is a go to place for me. The Battlestar Galactica rollercoaster is one you should not miss, its amazing and will give you tons of thrills. The HUMAN coaster is good for those who might have some fear of roller coasters, but if you dont, I highly recommend CYLON. Also, the Mummy is amazing as well. My favorite ride has to be the Jurassic Park Rapids, however. Overall, I love this theme park and would recommend it if youre in Singapore.",

If you don't purchase an Express ticket, you may have to wait in line for 2-3 hours on some rides. If you're only going to be able to ride a few stations, boredom will replace the fun. And that day will be the day you are not impressed. The most impressive player Egypt looks like a museum at first glance. But once you enter, it becomes an extremely thrilling roller coaster. Adding to the fear of darkness It's a plaything that isn't child friendly at all. Please prepare yourself for the thrill and fear first. Transformers the ride is a simulator that projects 3D images as if we were actually in the vehicle. It is very fun and realistic. Human vs. Cylon, this one is the most brutal, a rollercoaster. Human rides on a train, while Cylon hangs his legs and plays with his hands completely numb. The greatest thrill has to be these two. The three types above are my favorites, but there are many others that I'm also impressed by. But if you don't want to lose your temper and waste all day waiting in line. Don't forget to buy Express tickets before entering. Have a fun trip.",

With its wide range of thrilling rides and attractions, it has become a top tourist destination for families and friends alike. I recently had the opportunity to visit the park, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience. The first thing that struck me about Universal Studio Singapore was its impressive collection of rides. From heart-pumping roller coasters to interactive simulators, there was something for everyone. One of my personal favorites was the Transformer ride, which was an incredible 3D experience that transported me into the world of the Autobots and Decepticons. It was so realistic that I felt like I was part of the action. However, it's worth noting that the park can get quite crowded on weekends and holidays. This can lead to long wait times for the rides and difficulty navigating through the crowds. However, if you plan your visit during the weekdays, the park is significantly less crowded, and you can enjoy all the rides and attractions without having to wait in long lines. Despite the crowds, the overall atmosphere of the park is infectious. There's a palpable energy and excitement in the air that is hard to describe. The park is immaculately maintained, and the staff is friendly and helpful. One downside to visiting Universal Studio Singapore is that you'll need a full day to enjoy everything the park has to offer. In fact, it took me around six hours to explore the entire park and experience all the rides. That said, it's worth every minute, as the memories you'll make here are priceless. In conclusion, if you're looking for a fun-filled adventure, Universal Studio Singapore is an absolute must-visit. The park's fantastic rides, thrilling attractions, and energetic atmosphere make it a unique and unforgettable experience. Just remember to plan your visit during the weekdays to avoid the crowds and make the most out of your time here.",

It has two kinds of roller coasters \"Battlestar Galactica\" is the world's tallest two-track mountain coaster The car is composed of two roller coaster tracks and is divided into \"sitting type\". (Human Team)\" and \"Suspension (Mechanical Team)\" The sitting type means that your feet have the ground to step on, while the hanging type means that your feet are suspended in the air. In my opinion, the hanging type is faster. \"Shrek's Far Far Away\" is a highly recommended place to go to the 4D cinema. The plot is about saving Princess Fiona with Shrek and Donkey. The seats will shake according to the plot, and water will spray out when Donkey sneezes. \"The Lost World\" Be sure to go see the (Future Water World) live show with full sound and light effects, very exciting and exciting, the front row seats will get wet, it is recommended to queue up 20 minutes in advance",

The immersive experiences, sharp turns, and steep drops made for an unforgettable adventure. But it wasn't all about the rides - the WaterWorld show was a spectacular display of stunts, pyrotechnics, and action-packed fun. I was on the edge of my seat as the performers pulled off daring feats and explosive stunts. After all that excitement, I needed some retail therapy, and the Transformer shop delivered! I geeked out over the impressive collection of Autobot and Decepticon merchandise, and scored some awesome souvenirs to take home. The park's theming, attention to detail, and friendly staff all added to the magic of the day. Whether you're a fan of movies, TV shows, or just plain old-fashioned fun, Universal Studios Singapore has something for everyone. Highly recommend to buy express ride tickets. In short, USS is a must-visit destination for any thrill-seeker or pop culture enthusiast. Get ready for a day of non-stop action, adventure, and unforgettable memories!",

And water is not cheap either! 3. Eat before you go... so you have energy, and so you wont need to spend so much on food when you are there. Unless of course if you are there for the food too. 4. The ice cream at the entrance/exit is a must-try! Loved my raspberry cookie dough scoop on a waffle cup!",

For fans who have followed all three seasons, the experience is great. I feel that the scenes, characters, and story sequence are very particular when making the haunted house.

We have purchased the Express pass, by around 1pm we have finished all games we want to try. So I think an Express pass is not a absolute must like what happened in USJ. The scariest ride is definitely Revenge of the Mummy. Discouraged anyone who can't handle a roller coaster ride to try. It happened in darkness, there is scary element, and the falls is rapid and happened in a row. So yeah, it is exciting and scary.",

Picture yourself screaming your lungs out on a rollercoaster , high-fiving your favorite movie characters , and maybe even getting soaked on a water ride (spoiler alert: you *will* get soaked!) . You can explore different themed zones, from Ancient Egypt to New York City, feeling like you've traveled the world in a single day! It's a place where you can feel like you're starring in your own action-packed movie! However, let's be honest, sometimes \"theme park\" can feel a bit like a real-life game of \"dodge the strollers,\" where you're trying to navigate the crowds while also trying to avoid getting your toes run over . And while the thrills are undeniably amazing, you might also find yourself questioning your ability to resist the urge to buy all the souvenirs, especially if you're a sucker for a character-themed plushie or a limited-edition popcorn bucket . Plus, those queues can get long, so pack your patience and maybe a snack or two! Overall, Universal Studios Singapore offers an unforgettable and exhilarating experience, a place where you can unleash your inner child, create lasting memories, and maybe even conquer your fear of heights, even if you sometimes feel like youre participating in a synchronized queueing session with a hundred other thrill-seeking adventurers. Get ready for a day of fun, laughter, and maybe a few screams!",

Rides like Battlestar Galactica and Transformers are next-level fun, and the themed zones nail the Hollywood vibe. On quieter weekdays, youre zooming through queues, which is a dream. But, the food? Meh and way too pricey for what it is. Also, peak days can mean elbow-to-elbow crowds. Still, its a thrill-packed day thats hard to beat",
