But to enter with such a ticket is tantamount to throwing away money. It is simply necessary to take a Fast Pass to visit the attractions without queuing, which costs another 80 spd (60usd). Otherwise, you will stand in line for an hour in the heat for each attraction, even if it is a weekday. It is advisable to be light, because you cannot even take your phone with you to many attractions. In some places there are free storage lockers for a short time, but many are paid. Food and souvenirs are much more expensive than in other places. But this place is certainly very beautiful and worth a visit.",

The rides are not from the last century, but even from the century before last, and after standing in line for an hour or more, it can close for an unknown reason because it is broken. There is only fast food, and the most expensive in the world, no choice, only chicken and incomprehensible potato balls. Everything is spicy, unacceptable for Europeans. I do not even consider local food like noodles. In 6 hours spent on this Sentosa we visited only 2 rides, and as I said earlier we left one because it was broken. Money wasted. Basically, after buying tickets you just end up in a bunch of shops selling stuffed toys made in China. There are probably more of these shops here than cafes and rides combined.",

You can finish all games on the same day provided you have an Express Card with you. Its price is approximately 200 riyals, which means that with admission, it is 400 riyals per person. Possessing the card does not mean that you will enter the game at all times, but you will be transferred to a second queue that is shorter than the main one (it saves approximately half the waiting time). Some games are not worth the wait at all. The place is very hot and there are no air conditioners, fans or water sprinklers. Drinking water is available for free through taps, but unfortunately it is not cold (I am surprised, given the high cost of tickets, that there is no cold water), which is of course a way to force you to buy from the kiosks (whose prices are astronomical). Everything is overpriced (imagine a picture for 35). The biggest bad thing about it is that it closes completely at seven oclock (when the weather starts to get mild). In general, it is a must-visit place to complete your trip in Singapore.",

The price is 82 dollars. We took it from the hotel for 80 dollars, a small amount other than in America.

It's a relatively small place and if you are not someone who enjoys rides or shows, this would be a waste of time and money. The rollercoasters and rides we tried were good. We do recommend going for Transformers and Revenge of the Mummy. Please expect long wait times for most rides unless you have a express or unlimited pass, for which of course, you shell out more. The show at WaterWorld was the highlight of our trip to USS. Definitely one of the best, if not the only thing we felt was worth going for. The prices for food and drinks are simply exorbitant inside. So prepare accordingly. There are lockers conveniently provided outside every ride to keep your bags. We also recommend going on weekdays. Even though we went on a Monday, there was still quite a crowd. So weekends are likely to be worse. All in all, it is probably worth a one time visit to see what the fuss is all about, but it is unlikely we will return.",

As a family of three, we also paid another 121SPD entry fee for the aquarium and for the photo that you were allowed to take at the entrance (free), you would of course have paid 65SPD at the end of the tour, packaged as a souvenir. The aquarium was ok, I've seen bigger ones. The jellyfish were the most impressive thing for me. We would also have liked to visit Delphine Island, but we would have had to pay the entrance fee there too. All in all, in my opinion it wasn't worth the price we paid. I am very disappointed.

If you purchase the Express Pass for over 7 million VND, you wont need to wait in lines everywhere. However, if you opt for regular tickets, be prepared to queue for each ride, which can take anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes, sometimes even with 100 people ahead of you! The term rides here doesnt necessarily mean actual games; it often refers to attractions where you sit and enjoy the experience. Universal Studios offers various themed areas, including NYC, Transformers, Ancient Egypt, Jurassic Park, and Far Far Away (soon to have a Minion land). However, there arent too many games. If you visit, prioritize the Jurassic Park ride (remember to bring a raincoat from homeit costs 10,000 VNDbecause the 6 SGD per person fee here will leave you as wet as a soaked mouse! ). Next, try the Transformer ride (it felt so real that it made my heart skip a beat). Theres also an impressive show that recreates an action scene from JAWS, directed by Steven Spielberg. Its fantastic, although experiencing 2-3 scenes instead of just 1 would be even more satisfying! For younger visitors, the other attractions are more relaxed. Universal Studios has several roller coasters, but unfortunately, my digestion and heart arent up to the task, so I couldnt review them. Overall, the 1.4 million VND per person price tag for an experience comparable to what youd find in the United States didnt leave me completely satisfied. Id rate it a 7 out of 10. Heres hoping for a Disneyland visit someday to add to my reviews!",

But the sectors like hollywood, Jurassic world , waterworld and four others - they all give your money's worth. You must ride the rollercoasters particularly the roller coaster named cyclone but I would strongly recommend those with neck and head injury or if you have some kind of trouble in your heart , not to indulge . Other than these there are many options in the pyramid that is the Egypt segment or the Sci-Fi segment I would recommend everyone to watch them. There are various segments with heater is I personally 8 and patriot Jurassic world overall there are 7-8 restaurants. There are other food stalls and drink stalls as well. There are numerous stalls where mementos are available with the sticker of the logo of universal studios those things are dam costly I mean food be interested in buying a minion 6 to 7 inches soft toy with a price tag of around 30 US dollars!!! Not me. But the design of the whole amusement park is amazing and with just a single ticket you can virtually spend the whole day with your family. I think it's a must see if you go to Singapore.",

It's overpriced for the number and length of the rides and impossible to enjoy without the express pass. The rides themselves are mostly entertaining, but extremely short. The park was also quite well managed with enthusiastic staff to help at every turn. Speaking of the express pass. We purchased ours in advance expecting to be able to take all rides using it. Unfortunately, the freshly opened Minions section of the park required yet another upgraded express pass on arrival. Looking at the attractions in that section, we decided we'd spent enough at this park. In addition to that, transport to the island is completely inadequate for the number of visitors. Given the cost of any of the attractions, I don't expect to be shoved into a two-car monorail and covered in the sweat of others before I even arrive. This needs a serious upgrade. Take a quick look at the Disney parks in Hong Kong or Tokyo for inspiration. The rides to those parks are comfortable and inspire you to have fun with its decor. This one just feels like it's squeezing your wallet open by packing you into the train. On a final note, the food was some of the best we've had at a theme park. Typically parks like these serve scraps at best, but it was actual restaurant food here. Well done on that!",

That said, we did enjoy ourselves, but we wanted for more. We paid for express plus tickets at entry. Do not waste your time or money. We did not feel that it was worth it.

The price is quite inflated and there are continuous costs. For instance I was told I should put my backpack in a locker so I paid 35 dollars outside the park to put my bag away and just kept a small cross body bag for my wallet. Then when you try and go on certian rides you thin need to buy a locked in the park for your smaller item and suddenly one ride is costing you 15 so you can store your bag for it. So if your alone this is an expensive day of storing your items and if your with people expect one person to sit out and wait with your bags The food as all theme parks go was of course over priced. But this is a pretty well known fact so always eat before and bring snacks. The size of the park is quite small compared to others and the majority of the rides were more or less 4d so your just sitting in a cart rattling with screens around you more than anything really. I do not recommend buying tickets at the gate as I found them through tour companies much cheaper",

Ticket Prices Are High A one-day adult ticket can cost SGD 8298 (around USD 6072), and express passes add another SGD 40100. For that price, visitors expect more fully functioning attractions and smoother operations. 2. Multiple Ride Closures or Technical Issues Key attractions like WaterWorld and Amber Rock Climb are closed. Others like Transformers and Canopy Flyer have frequent delays or breakdowns. With only about 78 major rides, even 23 closed significantly reduces the value. 3. Food Is Exorbitantly Priced Basic vegetarian meals (like rice with vegetables or noodles) can cost SGD 1520 per person. Snacks like popcorn, ice cream, or drinks are overpriced, especially with no outside food allowed. Limited budget or vegetarian options add to the difficulty. 4. Comparisons with Other Parks Parks like Universal Studios Japan or Universal Orlando offer more attractions, better-maintained rides, and often better guest serviceat a similar or slightly higher cost. Even Disneyland Hong Kong or Legoland Malaysia are seen by some as better value, especially for families.",

We had the option to stay in line but they couldn't provide a timescale for the fix. We tried to go back later in the day but we heard an announcement from outside that there was a 'short delay due to a fault'. That was the same message we heard repeatedly in the morning which had turned into an extended delay. We tried 'Battlestar Galactica' but that was closed for the entire day due another fault. As a result the queues for the other major rides where in excess of 2 hours each. As a family we decided to try the queues as 'single riders', where available, in the hope of getting on quicker. For the Transformer 3D ride we were warned that we'd have to wait 30 minutes. It ended up being 55 minuted. As a result we only went on about 5-6 rides all day. I felt robbed given how much we'd paid to get in. It's easy to identify ways that this park could shorten the queues. An extra member of staff on each ride would make the changeover a lot quicker. Also on the drink stalls, my wife queued for 15 minutes to get a slush because there was 1 person taking the money and preparing the drinks. If one person sorted the payment and a 2nd person prepared the drinks the queues would be a fraction of the size. It annoys me that these places charge the earth and provide such poor service.",

Although many of them can communicate in Chinese, they don't smile much and their answers are not very patient. I also feel that the staff's adaptability (or work attitude) is not up to par. I queued for nearly 90 minutes for Transformers and when I got there (about 10 people left in front), I had already seen the car. At this time, the facility actually broke down (sorry)! The announcement kept saying that they didn't know when it would be repaired, so I had to wait for nearly 30 minutes. During this period, a bunch of impatient customers kept trying to leave from the back, but the staff on the scene didn't know where to go, causing the scene to be chaotic.

Time difficult to explain when seeing the waiting space occupied at 20-30% or even less!!! Time worsened by the extreme nonchalance of the staff who take their time and poorly manage the express line which annoys even more (or how to exasperate 99% of customers who have not opted for an Express Pass at a prohibitive price of 90-120 dollars! ) . Here too the commercial policy is more than doubtful and ineffective. As if by miracle, the addition of car in the roller coasters reduces the waiting time, but very late in the day! It is therefore either incompetence or deliberate will. In both cases this makes the experience execrable. The lockers are free for a period that depends on the waiting time for each attraction and that's the good news. In the end, a nice and successful park but ruined by particularly incompetent operating and sales staff!",

There was nothing an adult could do in Hollywood, Madagascar or New York.. that leaves us with just a few more parks to go and not all has exhilarating outdoor rides, some just have boring indoor rides, only parent with kids would go there. To top it up it was raining and due to the lightning alert, they closed the outdoor rides from 3pm to 5.30pm. The entire place shuts at 7pm which gave us less time to complete our outdoor rides. And when the rides finally opened up, of course everyone rushed to the queue, we waited 40 minutes for each ride and only managed 2 roller coaster rides. I think when such safety hazards surface (which is of course out of their hands) its only fair that they allow an extra hour for the park to be open, for us who paid full fare to at least make use of the ticket and have a good experience. Also, the staff were completely uninterested from the entrance onwards. A fun park is usually expected to have some motivation, fun faces, fun pitch intonations, enthusiastic participation etc..to create a hype among the visitors there.. but most of them were just mundane, bored with their job, not even a hi when we entered a ride. I could count the numbers of staff who were enthusiastic and sadly that was only about 10%. Its a shame that Universal Studio Singapore doesnt stand up to other Universal Studios around the world, and its one of the most global countries in South East Asia.",

And the first halloween event i went to was mainly queuing queuing and more queuing. Understandably, it was the first halloween event so there's definitely more people who are curious bout it and hence the queue lines exploded. (I have never went back for the halloween events so I can't review anythin bout that) However, I guess it's also because there's no new rides, so when you re-visit the park (off- peak days) to maybe show some foreign friends around, the wait time can be really short or even no wait time. Food is definitely way overpriced. I ate at JP's discovery restaurant, every item on the menu were 13 (Fish bee hoon soup, chicken rice, 8 piece chicken drum sticks and fish bites..if my memory serves me) Sodas were 5 each. Kid's meal was 14. So yea, I would recommend to eat outside if you can because the food was just mediocre. Overall, it's still one attraction that's worth visiting once in a while..",

The funny thing was that almost all the time we were obligated to leave our stuff in lockers and these lockers were for free only for 30-40minutes. After that there was 4 dollars fee for every 20 minutes. But almost all the time we had to wait for the attraction for more that 1 hour, so it was so unfair. It is not worth to pay so much money for this experience!!!",

If it suddenly rains, all outdoor rides will stop. The day I went was a market day, so it rained in the middle of the day, so a huge crowd gathered indoors. There are too many people even on weekdays. Half Indian, half Chinese. There are people in India and China who openly cut in line. Truly disorderly. It will be dirty because it is disorderly. Since the population is large, there are bound to be many people like that. Wherever you go in Singapore, you will find Indians and Chinese everywhere. So I dont really have any intention of going back. Half of the people on Earth are Chinese and Indian, so there seems to be no place on Earth where they can go to avoid these two races. Transformers and Mummy are decent. The others are just for babies. The weather seems to be unpredictable, with rain coming and going. Directions to Universal Studios are poor. It is best to ask at the information desk or ticket office. Universal Studios is very small. Is there an attraction worth taking up an entire day?

We tried to pick the rides with the shortest queues but when the advertised wait time was 20min it was closer to 1h. Advertised 5min was really 15min. To be fair on one ride advertised time was 45mins and the wait was really only 20mins. Also, yes the queue is shorter with express tickets but that's another 100 per person, these are not available for all rides, there was still quite a queue so I'm not sure it makes a big difference. Several times during the day we were very close to leaving the park with hundreds of spent and having only done a couple of kids rides.. Then after 6pm queues started to become more acceptable and the evening was enjoyable. I just wish we would not have wasted most of our day waiting around in the heat as we could have done nearly as many rides if we would have just come at 6pm. Bad organization also did not help: Unclear signage led to people wasting time waiting in the wrong queue (happened to us and several other people I observed) or e.g. flighting over seats in the cinema.",

The Mummy- waited for 5-10 mins, this was the shortest time we had to wait for a popular ride. There's a starbucks here if you like starbucks. There are other shops and food stalls, and some decent restaurants too. After riding the mummy, most of the queues were about 45 mins - 1 hr. The Jurassic park was the longest one, around 2 hrs. We went to sea world instead and came back when most of the crowds were going home. Rode the roller coasters twice with no queue and jurassic park too. This was after 5pm, the park closes at 10 pm. So we had plently of time to take photos around the park, eat and relax while everyone was on the queue. Or you can purchase the express pass 3x the standard price if you can't be bothered.",

The way the staff dealt with it was also very rude and they rushed tourists away, which was very bad! Since tickets bought in advance cannot be changed, we can only accept Universal's statement that \"the company has the right to change the time.\" Although Japan Global is more expensive, the service is much better than in Singapore. Singapore Global's service and handling methods are really terrible. For a large global company, Singapore Global's handling is very poor!",

Honestly this was one of the worst paid for 'experiences' we've ever had anywhere in the world. 1.5hrs of queuing for a ride which said it was a 45 min wait at the start. The ride took 7.5 mins. Another one was a 45min wait for a 35 sec ride. Hot, stinky, crowded queues. Two of the family rides weren't even working when the park opened because of what the staff said were technical problems. The kicker is when you do decide to pay the extra 70SGD pp for an 'Express' ticket to jump the queue, they then use surge pricing and say it will cost 140SGD pp (no discount for kids). Even those with Express tickets had to wait 45mins to ride the Jurassic Park Rapids when the average ticket holder had to wait 2hrs. In the midst of this self-punishment I tried to get a beer. Waited in line for 5 mins to get to the front only to be told the 11SGD beer had sold out. I guess there were other desperate adults who'd got there quicker. As well as that when the kids wanted photos with the characters they were told no, only photos taken by professional photographers. Like I said, if you like to wait in line sweating while having your pockets emptied by Universal then you'll love it.",

Single riders option closed whenever the staff feel the wait time is too long overall - which is always. Wait time off peak on a Monday even at 30 minutes before the park was closing was 45 minutes for some rides. During the day wait times were up to 120 minutes for all major attractions. Way too many people are allowed in the park, perhaps more than should be. Due to the huge crowds (not even school holidays when I went) it takes twice as long to even walk from point a to point b. It rained three times and the entire crowd ran for cover, leaving each store and water crowded as though on a busy train. Minimal facilities for Rain cover except for the entrance way street. The Jurassic park ride was a huge let down. Its more of a float boat. Doesnt have Harry Potter world, the Simpsons, the living dead and a few other attractions as in LA.

We really enjoyed most of the rides & although some queue times were an hour or more we managed to do pretty much everything in a day. I'd really liked Universals attention to detail & we decided to go to Singapore this year after visiting Japan Universal Studios last year (which was amazing). I can't fault the attention to detail on the rides or the special effects shows but unfortunately this park lacks a wow factor like Harry Potter or similar. It just doesn't feel as magical. But what unfortunately let the whole experience down & spoilt the day for us was the lack of customer service, unclean restaurants & awful food. We'd had great food in Japan so were expecting a similar experience. Unfortunately it left a lot to be desired. We went to Mel's diner for lunch & had chicken burgers. When we ordered we were told not to expect them hot because the cold lettuce & tomato cools down the chicken. I asked were they fresh (of course) as alarm bells started to ring, I should have walked away at this point. We'd had these burgers before in the Japan equivalent so were expecting good things. These were unfortunately the most disgusting chicken burgers we had ever eaten. It was chicken leg bits & skin re formed together & deep fried but when you took a bite it was a grey slimey mush. See picture. All were the same so we didn't bother complaining as it looked like that's just how they come. Quite embarrassing given its an American Diner. I've never seen a chicken burger look like this. Cold limp chips & own brand awful ketchup. The restaurant was also filthy, greasy tables not wiped after multiple guests & food all over the floors with tables crammed together to pack people in. Burger Cost S16 plus S5 for drink so daylight robbery for what you get. I could only manage 1 bite of mine, almost sick, so went about half an hour later to another Universal fast food joint in Far Far Away for a pizza to fill the gap left by the burger/fries. No better, most were burnt so I sent the one I was given back. I would describe this as a child's value supermarket pizza, with a cheap bread base (even with the little pin holes you get on those pre manufactured frozen pizza bases). Disgraceful for the money S13 & as if they found the cheapest pizza they could to palm off on unsuspecting tourists. Customer service at most points during the day was bad, from being told we have to leave the park to get ladies sanitary products when urgently required, to rude, condescending & unhelpful staff. There didn't seem that many staff around either & there certainly wasn't the usual happy smiley US customer service experience. Disappointing!",

Using a universal app that tells the time can help you optimize your waiting time. As a show, the Water World show was okay, but I personally wasn't very impressed because it was the same content I saw in the US 12 years ago.

Sadly, the park is always super crowded. We went on a monday at the opening, queued for 2h30 for the transformer ride, and it broke down while we were still in the queue. The mummy ride was close for the day (of course they couldn't mention it on the website or infront of the park before buying tickets) The whole park is a money grab. It's unacceptable to pay 79 (which is so expensive even for Singapore standards??) and have two rides broke down, especially with a park that small. Of course they do not accept refund, but a compensation would have been appreciated. We stayed for 5 hours in the park, and we did one ride after queuing for 2h45 before leaving. We literally payed 79 per person to stay in a line. Even the express queue was full. Imagine paying 80 to skip the queue and still have to wait an hour. I've been there a few times, and the few last ones were a waste of time and money. Go once to say that you've been there, but that's it. The only time I had a similar experience in another park was years ago, where one ride broke down and we got new tickets sent as an apology without asking. I'm not saying USS should start accepting refund or whatever, but you could say it's a bit annoying when you leave the queue after queuing for almost 3 hours, and the only thing they say is 'hope you guys come again!' Trust me, I try to give this park a chance, because I think it's a very pretty park with great rides, but I can't. Too crowded.",

Each ride has an average waiting time of 120 minutes. Even the waiting area was devoid of any sitting arena causing immense stress on our feet. The management must limit the selling of tickets per day so that all can enjoy the park. It needs to address the issue of seating for the elderly and children.",

First of all you pay soo much for entry which is useless without paying the extra cash for the skip-the-line ticket. Every ride was over 60 minutes wait and some even had 130 minutes! And keep in mind that you have to store your belongings in lockers which give a free charge for only 80 minutes and after that you pay 4 dollars every 20 min. So imagine you have a ride with a waiting time of 130 minutes and then have to pay because of this. There was even a ride which had a technical error and was delayed longer which forced us to pay for the locker for their own fault! In addition prices for food were very expensive and nothing was served fresh. Everything tasted like it was left there for days outside. Moreover, the park is VERY small and you can walk around it in 7 minutes. Other than that the attractions are very fun and well thought of and there are a couple of free events and shows which were nice. But it is not worth the money as you have to buy an express pass including the normal ticket to not have that long waiting line.",

Install fans, exhaust fans and deodorizer on the restroom. Most toilet was very hot and smelt really bad, found some toilet have left over excrement (which was not the management fault) and i almost threw up. PLEASE REPLACE ALL TOILET WITH WASHLET, its better and way faster and cleaner than wiping!!! Cmon step up ur toilet game 3. In usj, the smoking area are fewer than in uss but they are secluded! In uss the smoking area are placed too close to the main road and the crowd.. 4.

The receiving area was small so my wife and my kids sat beside the counter together with my sister in law and father in law while I was the one who approach the counter and make order. One of my son was playing with our GO PRO camera,afterward he placed the said camera on the couch beside her mom then one of the staff called us to enter and approach the table they preparedfor us,unknowingly they left the Camera outside but we did not notice it at first, after eating we went out of KT's grill, a few min. And meters away from the resto me and my wife was rushing to go back to get the Camera.As we enter we approach the crew of the resto and they said they haven't seen any camera was left so we call on the manager to ask help if we could review the CCTV cameras of their resto and they said we have to follow the protocol of the eatablishment to report it to the Lost and Found Section and so we follow everything they told us to do. The Lost and found section took our contact # and told us to wait for their call as so we did.By around 5pm one of the staff of the Lost and Found Section called us just to tell us that they could not see the footage in that area where we alleged that the camera was left becauae the camera is in focus to the resto's reception counter only and the full area is not visible. We are so fraustrated with the KT's Grill as you can imagine the people entering there is not safe they cannot protect their customers from those theives around the area of their resto..if you visit the place you can clearly see what i realy ment that their cctv camera could not capture the area of their receiving where they took orders for the mere fact that the area was too small.i am very disappointed!",

                "review_text": "Yeah, well... Read all my tips below to make most of your visit here. Before I tell you the good, the tough message: You pay loads of money for some 5 min rides in a fake environment after waiting hours. That's the more critical view of it. On the bright side you see lots of happy faces having a once in a life experience. Some of the rides are stunning (Transformer ride, Cylon Battlestar Galactica Rollercoaster, Mummy, Jurassic Park Rapids, Canopy Flyer), others are soso and some, well, it's for kids, you know?! Restaurants are all quite expensive, but the Indian food opposite the Mummy ride is decent and not too expensive. Some more tips: 1. Don't do weekends. We did a Tuesday and had rather short lines. 2. Invest and take the Express ticket (take the 1 time express on each ride ticket, not unlimited - you won't have time for unlimited rides anyway). The express ticket helped to cut hours off our waiting times. Hours! And that was on a Tuesday. I can't begin to imagine the frustration on a weekend with a normal ticket... 3. Download the Universal Studio Singapore app from Google Play / Apple store. It shows the waiting times at each attraction and you can plan ahead. Times are not super accurate, but give you an idea what to expect. 4. Start at the back of the park and work your way forward to the attractions in the front. Coz everyone goes the other way and you beat the crowds and waiting lines this way. 5. Avoid going on school holidays. 6. Bring a water bottle to refill, they only sell paper cartons with water which are hard to refill. There is drinking water fountains at each waiting line and you can use that to refill. 7. Bring a shirt to change coz the Jurassic Rapids will most likely get you wet. If you found it helpful feel free give it a like so it shows on top and more people get helped with the tips.",

One announcement I heard was that in Cylon roller-coaster, expected waiting time for last person in standard queue was 2 hours..! So, if you don't buy express pass, you end up standing and waiting in queue for hours, to enjoy 2-5 minute rides.

Worst of all is that on two occasions after waiting for an hour the rides encountered technical glitch due to which we were asked to leave the ride. I saw couple of people stuck in the ride...... This was very annoying. To top it they close the park 5 before the official closing time of 6pm denying children right at the front of the ride.... Very unfriendly staff, even towards kids. Never seen anything like this in other parks in rest of the world.",

You have to store your stuff in a locker before entering the queue. The lockwrs are free for the first 100 min. Then cost money. Estimate for the line was 60 min. After waiting 85 min and getting near the front, there was an indeterminable delay and we just left in frustration. This was the second delay while in queue and no information was given regarding how long these would last. If we had stayed we would have exceeded 100min and been charged for the lockers. We had such a negative experience off this one ride alone we did a quick circuit of the park afterwards to see the sights and then left early. Wouldn't recommend.",

                "review_text": "SERVICE After trying various paid attractions and also 5 star hospitality services in various different places in Singapore, I got the impression that the workers who served us in various places did not understand how to serve customers. Of course the customer is not king, but customers pay money to get their service. So customers hope to receive the service they have purchased like customers, not just receive their money and then ignore it. The staff (especially young people) at various rides on the USS are generally reluctant to provide even the slightest information and are rude even when answering basic questions from customers. For example, when I and other guests approached the entrance to the Cyclon (roller coaster), the staff spoke quickly and their English pronunciation was far from standard so it was difficult to understand, it was only natural for customers to ask \"Excuse me, what do you mean by this is the last hour?\" the staff even got angry and shouted in response while looking away \"10 minutes\" he said. It turned out that the ride was taking a break for 10 minutes and there was no announcement, so many customers continued to come to the ride because they didn't know. Instead of conveying information about the break and when it would reopen, the staff immediately rejected customers curtly. It's not surprising that if other customers asked when it would reopen, the staff answered by shouting, rudely, curtly and angrily while turning around. Interestingly, in contrast to the attraction staff found on the streets in Universal Studios who are warm and smiling. These non-vehicle staff try to greet and smile at every customer passing by and don't even hesitate to ask them to take a group photo. OVERALLS The place is not big. Likewise with the number of rides, it is quite small. The only advantage or attraction of the USS is the roller coaster. If Dufan had a roller coaster that was better or at least the same as USS, of course the experience at USS would be even less memorable. The service from the workers at the rides is bitchy, rude, angry, degrading people who can't understand what they are saying as a sign that the tourists don't speak English, even though the tourists are fluent in English. Even though the experience offered by USS can be enjoyed and some of it is enjoyable, it all disappears or becomes less impressive because of the service provided by the staff who are rude, uninformative, lazy, angry, rude, etc.",

In fact he hadn't been on a rollercoaster in nearly 20 years, but I was about to change all that with our trip here. In preparation for our day out at USS, we bought the fast-track passes which more than earned their keep as the wait times for some rides were around forty minutes plus. And this was on a Thursday, too! It also meant that my partner didn't have too much time to stop and think before we found ourselves strapped in. Thanks to the fast-track pass (and my powers of persuasion) my partner and I managed to go on nearly every ride, which given his earlier hesitation I found incredible. We worked our way from the Madagascar rides all the way to the dueling Battlestar Galactica roller coasters, and I couldn't have been more proud. Whether it was the magic of being on holiday or a special something about USS, I can't say for certain, but what I do know is that he can't wait to go to another theme park. Seriously, however, I cannot stress the importance of the fast-track pass. Im a annual pass holder, and visiting USS every months. On 1st Dec around 14:50hrs, we were queuing for the ride CYLON, and met an extremely rude & unprofessional staff for the first time. I couldnt get her name since she just walked away but she was wearing yellow color jacket & Chinese looks, wearing a spec, and a ponytail hair. Just because of we are Japanese, she said several Japanese words towards us such as; mendokusai which means troublesome! Thank you so much for your kind words ya. Totally disappointed and we immediately left USS after the ride.",

Can you not speak? During the 55-minute wait in line for Treasure Hunt, the instrument completely stopped twice. Of course, it is necessary under safety conditions, but the service staff looked indifferent to the guests and did not explain it. Even when the machine stopped for the second time, they looked at each other and laughed, and the guests in line were so sad that they wanted to cry. It ended by picking up an empty can under a game vehicle. Not only did the guests have no interest in playing at this time, but the service staff were still completely stupid, as if the only thing that was interesting was when the machine was down. All of these happened on January 25, 2020. Compared to Hong Kong, which I have visited more than a dozen times, the Japanese Disney service staff are full of smiling professionalism, allowing guests to feel a full atmosphere of joy as soon as they enter the park. \"Universal Studios Singapore is really disappointing.\"",

Often the waiting time indicated at the entrance does not correspond to reality; sometimes we waited longer. Google maps at the park indicates that it is open until 20:00 on Friday, all the swings were closed at 19:00 - we did not count on this. If you want to have a good ride, its better to come late in the evening - probably 16:00. At other times there are hourly queues( It is better to ride only on the top swings - the rest are not worth your time. Dragons are no fun - you constantly think about how not to get wet, the attraction itself is uninteresting. The swing in the jungle is also useless. Better than roller coasters, Egypt and transformers. Another cool special effects show. We didn't like the rest.",

We had like 2 to 3hr waiting time.i still gave 4 stars because they are doing a great job of keeping the place clean and tidy. Even though they get 8000 to 10000 guests per day the place looks neat. Character visits are also not enough when the park is busy. And the food inside is expensive.",

Upon returning to the locker immediately after the ride, it was locked up due to expiry of time limit and I was forced to pay a fine to retrieve my belongings despite trying to explain the situation to the locker crew. There weren't any staff that could redress such issues at the BSG. There weren't any staff available along the way as well and I have to make my way all the way back to the ticket entrance customer service. And there was such a long queue that the usher outside the office advised me to come back later. Basically, it is compulsory to place all your belongings in lockers located near the entrance of thrilling rides. I have seen more than a few riders being sent off because they have stuff inside their pockets just before their turn for the ride. You will definitely be bored to death while queuing more than 60 minutes without your mobile phone and stuff, especially if you are a single rider. So be mentally prepared.",

No rides with more recent technologies as i enjoyed in Disney Orlando in 2015. - not much interesting rides, results in a very long wait time on those rides. Maybe only 4 from the total of 28 rides are great, the others are standard and mostly can be found in any other amusement park. Even for the 'standard' rides the wait could be long as well; thus not worth it if you're on the regular lines. - overpriced, and the pricey express pass is not worthed considering the limited choices of interesting rides they have. - better to be a single rider instead to beat the very long and tiring queue. More likely you will be assigned on different vehicles, but for me it is acceptable compared to waiting on the very long regular line. - closes too early at 7:00 PM on weekdays, on weekends they closes at 8:00 PM but the queue is longer as well. they also easily closed the rides for safety reasons when there's just a little rain, which adds up the frustration. Don't come on a rainy day anyway. - for those reasons, i think coming here just once is enough. better to go to trans studio bali instead...

The queue times varied between a max of 50 minutes to litterly empty queues. The average wait time during my visit was /- 5 minutes per ride. Looking at the parks history they are adding new attractions regularly. With Battlestar Galactica now reaching an age of 10 years the park is in need of a new thrill-ride to stay relevant for thrillseekers. In my opinion a Spinning-coaster would be a grate addition to the already grate lineup. A rather compact spinning-coaster could fit just perfectly in the upcoming \"Minion Park\".

Sadly I can't really give 5 rates to Universal Studio Singapore because some reasons : 1. I arrived at Sentosa Island around 10 am, and for I know the gate is open at 10am ( sorry if i'm wrong ). but after a loooooonggggggg queue, the gate was opened at 11am. I'm not really sure what was the cause. Oh, and I was used the regular ticket, not the express pass. But it was okay. we were passed the entrance gate around 11.30 am. 2. Second problem, in the morning the attractions were mostly closed. I just got into maybe 1 or 2 attractions at the first round. Because we already finished circling the theme park around at 1pm, we decided to go around one more time. And in second around, we notice some of the attraction started to opened. It's kinda sad because they didn't give us a good reason why the attraction was closed. 3. My girlfriend said, its a little bit small for a theme park because she already visited disney land in Hongkong last year. But I can said, for the first timer, I have so much fun, especially in transformers attraction. it's really cool tho. So for me 4/5 stars i think ;)",

At the raptor meet and greet, a random officer interrupted and snarled \"no more!\" when I was just telling my husband about the queue for photo. At the Goldilocks eatery, we were given a buzzer for our waffles that never buzzed. 30 minutes later, we went back to the counter and they told us either somebody else took our food or they forgot about our order. So we had to wait another 30 minutes as our 16-month-old toddler grew impatient. At Treasure Hunters, our attempt to take a photo was met with a crass \"no photo!\" I saw them using similar tone on other visitors, too.",

During my visit all good cafes inside were closed with only fast food left. That was very disappointing. Not many attractions for adults. Literally a few rollercoasters. But for kids the park is great!",

Even with the express tickets, it was still quite some wait, that just goes to show how crowded it was :// The staff there didn't seem too jolly, it's probably my 4th or so time visiting, but this was most likely one of the worse visits.

However, when the USS Ticket Inspector checked my pass, he mentioned that I had to make a reservation on the RWS website prior to visiting and I was advised to return another day as the park was full. As I had made bookings on Klook for the USS tickets before, this came as a surprise. (Discovered later that Klook's booking system is not live and not linked to USS's ticketing system. Anyone can book tickets on the actual day even though the park is full but when you try to register with RWS, you will not be able to obtain the ticket. So beware when you purchase from Klook. Purchase from the main USS website instead). Fortunately, a bespectacled Customer Service Officer named Vincent who was checking the tickets in the queue came to our assistance. He rendered great service and managed to let us into the park and we are grateful to him for that. Thank you for letting my two daughters have a wonderful day at USS.",

Before arriving, it is recommended to check the weather forecast for the day (many roller coasters will be closed on rainy days). On major holidays, remember to go to any gift shop inside to buy a fast-pass pass (Priority Pass 70 each can be used once/Priority Pass unlimited times 100). Admission tickets are not included. The priority card is much faster. For example, people need to wait in line for 60-120 minutes, while the priority card only takes 5-10 minutes for your turn. Because not many people buy priority certificates. In fact, what you use money to buy is not a fast-track ticket, but the purchase time does not require you to wait in line for too long. (Each game requires an average of 60-120 minutes of waiting) Pay attention to the performance time to watch the show and take photos. You can download the universal studio map from Google Play to check the queue time and location to see where you are to avoid getting lost. If you dont buy a priority pass, it is recommended to arrive early on weekdays. Except for some game shows that are closed, water stations are prohibited at every intersection and you need to spend money to buy drinks/water.",

We used the Rediscover vouchers, bought the tickets from Klook which offers an early entry (12am) at 66, and had to make an online reservation after buying the ticket.

There's also re-entry allowed so you can go out to have a meal before coming in if the food inside is not to your liking. Do inform the exit staff you will be re-entering. Bring umbrellas if its the rainy season. Rain coats not recommended as you will still need to take it off when going for rides. Taking it off and putting it on repeatedly when going for rides is a hassle. It opens until pretty late at night, but basically during dinner time the crowds almost dissipate. If going during peak periods, it is recommended to get express pass. 5 mins per ride is very different from 1-2hrs per ride! You can even take the same ride 6-7 times if so desired. But since you can always buy passes on the spot, you can use your normal ticket, look at the crowd condition on the actual day, then decide if you want to buy express.

It seems to me to create artificial demand so the park and rides operate at a certain capacity always. I wish it was like lesser known theme parks overseas where rides are walk up and wait for the next turn. Not a queue of minimum 40min. With ticket prices like this already, why cant one make a beeline for Battlestar roller coasters, do 5 consecutive runs, and be out of USS within 1.5hours? Instead, every ride has a queue of at least 30min, and the ride lasts all of 5min. And the lack of drinks station is unbelievable. To buy drinking water, the queue is the same as those ordering food(?!) very long. Why not place vending machines throughout the park, or drinks-only stands. Made worse by the opening time of 2pm, possible heat injury is a real danger! I know this is an attraction, so would pay up to 10 for a 500ml bottle of drinking water, if only there were more stands selling them to ensure no queue for drinks.",

I went on a drizzly Thursday afternoon in April, which meant that there was little or no queues for many of the rides. The longest queue I experienced was around 30 minutes for the Transformers ride, which I visited around 3pm. The wait was alright because the queue passed through various chambers with exhibits & panels before the ride itself. I revisited the Transformers ride at 7pm, and this time there was no queue. A small part of the Universal Studios complex is sheltered (the New York and Sci-Fi sections) in case of rain. There are also numerous indoor rides around. The most thrilling rides are both outdoor Battlestar Galactica rides, and the Mummy indoor ride. There are some other relaxing rides that are more suitable for young children, or those not inclined for thrills. Food & drink is extremely expensive within USS. Do note that ALL the water coolers are not operating (as at April 2021). To get around this, you can consider stashing your own food & drink in your bag to bring into the park. Alternatively, exit the park and ask for a hand stamp for re-entry, before heading out to a 7-11 store or similar places for a quick drink. All in all, not too bad an experience to temporarily feel like you are outside Singapore.",

Safe distancing measures were enforced, queue time was relatively faster than non covid time due to lesser crowd. Enjoy greater peace and comfort cos usually theres a row left empty for safe distancing. Be prepared for rain during this season as it rained when I was there, thus many rides were suspended. During the rain / lightning warning Alert can only queue for indoor rides which mostly was the mummy ride or transformer ride and the queue then can be 40-60min. Only thing is have to wear a mask all the time which can be pretty stuffy and uncomfortable so i suggest prepare extra mask for your visit. Also, all water cooler refill stations are not in service so be sure to bring your own water otherwise drinking water going at 4.",

Have to wear masks all the time even for photo taking and staffs will not help you to take photos because of the Covid. Only selfie is allowed if you want a group photos. But all the characters are cute they know how to make you laugh. The rides are practicing social distance too. They will separated groups in different cars in the car. Like transformer ride, only the first row and last row of the car are allowed to be seated. All the performance has been suspended due to the Covid measures. No shows and performance. On the other hands, its not as much people compared to before Covid. Not like we have to queue a long time for the rides.",

Waterworld is closed, the Steven Spielberg show is closed as well. My friends & I didnt know that the rides were only operating till certain schedules. As it wasnt stated anywhere on the brochure or notice board. We did not know and we blindly went to the other rides, spending a long time queuing up. We missed out on the good stuff. Lets face it, only the Mummy Human & Cylone ride are the best rides in USS. Yet we couldnt get on them. Its really disappointing. There was a free snack which are just chicken nuggets. My friends boyfriend couldnt eat it as hes a vegan so he was really hungry for the entire period of time. We felt really bad as well since there wasnt any vegetarian food for him. The water dispensers were all turned off as well. So youd be forced to buy the 5 water. There should be a sign on the USS website stating what rides are closed, and the other rides that are still operating, their schedules. So people can plan their trip appropriately and instead we just slowly strolled around without knowing all the crucial information. Only go if youre ok with the kiddy rides, Long queues, watered down experience, hot weather & mask wearing for the whole time.",

Understandably, the pandemic has watered down everything to the extent that there is barely any feel of Halloween. They chose to pipe in loud club music instead of scary music, there are no 'scarers' except the social distancing ambassadors that will appear randomly to say '2 in a group ah'. The 'scare alley' was over in 20 seconds? The exhibition was OK and actually quite informative but because there was just so many people I felt pressured to keep walking instead of reading every single infopanel like I usually do (am a museum buff). So many rides were closed, which meant that queues were long (even though kids are having their Os and A levels and on paper there should be less of a crowd). We got the express pass but I shudder to think what would happen if we didn't. We probably get to queue for 2 rides and that's it. I guess that's a scare too. Save your money and catch a horror movie, you'll get more of a kick than coming here ...for now (at least till after the pandemic)",

Rides were high quality and nothing was scary for small child. Cons: heat was high and closed water access means buying lots of water/drinks from food stands. Prices are extortionate, 15 for a fountain drink is near criminal. But you're stuck and have no other options. I'd give 5 stars but this is particularly awful and unforgivable.",

While the rides themselves were just as good, there were several things that should be taken note of. I believe these are as a result of safe distance measures that have to be put in place but there should still be room for improvement. 1. Many many kiosks were closed which resulted in long queues at the other kiosks. 2. Again, many restaurants were closed too which also resulted in long queues elsewhere. 3. All water dispensers were shut off. I understand that its likely due to hygiene issue as a result of covid. 4. Expect very long queue at rides as they cannot be fully utilised due to safe distancing. Thats expected. 5. Several places were closed such as Waterworld, the theatre. Do check the website for more details. Overall, it seems like there was a shortage of staff. In some rides, I see only 1 staff that cause the queues to move slower. The same staff has to manage the queue, operate the ride and ensure safety before the ride begins. During peak hours, more staff should be hired to operate the food/drinks kiosk. Its expected that more people will be getting drinks since all water dispensers are not working. In short, avoid going during peak periods.",

Most food establishments were not opened (discovery food court seems to be forever closed and the food court near the Mummy ride was closed during visit) Rides were severely understaffed with boarding and disembarking processes taking longer than usual. Rides like the carousell had longer wait times than stated due to only one person manning both the lines and the ride itself and this is on a Sunday just after Christmas. I understand that there are safety distancing guidelines to follow but no proper measure is actually implemented. Water points are all disabled which makes it mandatory to either bring your own water or purchase water from the park at an exorbitant price. Stalls selling drinks like slushies had a long wait as well. Ambience wise was nice overall but there were plenty damages that were visible to the eye like potholes in the ground to dusts in the ceilings of the rides which showed very little maintenance is carried out. Operators manning the rides often talk too fast on the mic which makes their voice barely audible to be heard clearly. Overall the entire process could have been managed better. I really hope that future experiences can be better.",

So expect extreme long queue and waiting times for a table to have a proper meal in the remainder of the restaurants that are still open. Waiting times are even longer when it rains. Everyone will just want to stay inside and not move. Christmas decorations are totally disappointing. Apart from a few Christmas Trees, and some sort of promotion going on at the main plaza area, there isn't a hint of Christmas elsewhere.

Bring your own water, because bottled water is 4 per bottle (same price as canned drinks). Park was open 9 hours. My partner and I queued 1 hour for the mummy ride before it broke down and we had to leave without riding. No customer retention action taken (e.g. in Disney you might get a fast pass to come back later to take the ride in express queue). So we left disappointedly. Realised that with the normal lines being at least 1 hour long (mummy ride was 2.5 hours long at some point), we would only be able to fit in 5 rides at most, without resting. Buying express ticket for 60 per person was a worthy investment and the best choice we made!! Took 5 rides within 2 hours, had time to eat and rest. The whole park is obviously understaffed but that is understandable. Food took 45 min to queue for but we had 10% discount, turkey leg was a special experience, all in all good theme park food for 2 ppl less than 30 bucks! Water is in serious shortage, had to refill our bottles at the bathroom taps. Saw many teenagers looking very dehydrated as they are not wealthy enough to be purchasing 4 for water. Shops aren't really open, only some food open. Nothing fancy at this theme park and I will probably choose other countries if I could for universal studios, but no choice now haha. I hope all the staff stay well and it is good to see a healthy sized crowd still coming into the attraction. Only thing that bothered me was the lack of social distancing and blatant breaking of nationwide rules. As people realised throughout the day that they could get away with it, they stopped pretending they're in separate groups. Many groups of more than 5. Even saw 10. No social distancing in lines. SDAs here are USS internal staff so they also don't enforce (mainly they protect their own staff by keeping us at a distance). Many teenagers unaccompanied by parents, so nobody is telling them what they can or cannot do. Some even take off mask in line.",

USS is currently open only for 4 days a week (Thu-Sun) and there is a need to go online to book the entry slot timing of 12pm or 3pm as it is now the requirement due to COVID-19 Safe Management Measures. Entered at 12pm and the park was still relatively empty as most humans have not headed in yet. Some rides and shows are currently closed such as Shrek 4D, Lights Camera Action and Waterworld. Some rides started at 12pm such as the Cylons Vs Humans Roller Coaster, Particle Accelerator, Treasure Hunt, Jurassic World Rapids Ride and Madagascar Boat Ride. Some rides starts at 1pm such as Elmo's Spaghetti Adventure and Transformers. Some rides start at 2pm such as Revenge of the Mummy. Much planning is required to ensure the golden hour of 12pm to 1pm is not wasted waiting for rides to open. It was fun trying the different rides and glad that most are not undersized. Going through the rides brought much joy and laughter. Only bad part of going to a theme park, stuck in lines and the poor air circulation. More fans are needed for the long queues. Enjoyed a meal at Louis NY Pizza Parlor bringing back memories of pizza at Julianna's over in DUMBO. Really miss good pizza. Drinks are crazy expensive too at SG5 a cup. Glad that the free tickets came with 2 x 5 meal voucher and 2 x 5 off with min spend of SG25 meal voucher to help offset the cost of the food and drinks. All in a great day of fun and reminder why theme parks are not in my travel plans. Just do not like dealing with long queues for 1 to 2 mins of mirth. Not a place for bigger sized persons as all theme parks are loathe to do.",

And there was a lack of street side entertainment. So no Disney-style parades. Meet and Greets are also fairly detached and impersonal, you can't hug any of their characters for example.

Read this review first: We paid 4 tickets plus 4 express tickets at full price and went on Thursday 24 March 2022. This was our sons birthday present and their first ever USS experience going on rides. When we got there however we discovered that all the shows are closed (all incl. Waterworld, Shrek, ALL of them). Lights, Camera, Action ride is also closed. The food court is closed. Some of the restaurants were closed. Half the food trucks are closed. All water fountains are turned off. One has to walk half-way across the park to buy overpriced water. We queued for 15mins to buy 1 slush beverage even though we were just third in line. We waited another half hour to order pizza at one of the few restaurants that are open...and mind you, it was NOT crowded and there were just 4 guests in front of us, max. Finally, the website advertises a Madagaskar parade. Beware, that was not a parade. They were just a couple of dancers and 3 Madagaskar characters dancing at one spot. There is no parade as advertised. They also do not inform on their website that all the shows are closed. Also 2 rides were closed temporarily due to technical issues. And they also halted the outdoor rides for about 30mins due to lightning risk (we never heard any lightning nor did it ever rain). Overall the rides are still great but paying full price for getting just half the experience is very, very poor, and very disappointing. Ive been to the Universal Studios park many times in the US and in Singapore and THIS was the worst experience Ive ever had. I highly believe that this lack of service goes against the culture of the real Universal Studios corporation (they would never allow that). Like another user puts it, this is a complete rip-off.

I saw many that had '15' mins wait time written when the reality was one hour. The rides inside the park also start at different timings. This is the first time I've witnessed this at an amusement. Why can't all the rides start at the same time? Some rides are only open for 3 hours and the queues are 1.5 hours long. You are standing quite close to each in the queues due to covid restrictions they make people sit in only 2 rows to maintain social distance. Really need to do something about the long waiting time. What's even more ridiculous is that all outdoor rides were temporarily closed because of thunderstorm in an area close by. It wasn't even drizzling.",

However, the 1 star review is to reflect: 1. All water dispensers are shut off, which according to customer services, is due to covid-19. However, given that I have been able to use water taps to fill water bottles at gyms and other attractions in Singapore, this is clearly not a legitimate reason. It's just because resort just wants its customers to spend more money (min 4/bottle) on buying water. Even the restaurants are not allowed to provide tap water, which clearly has nothing to do with covid. Having already spent 70 - 80 per person on tickets. It is not fair to expect a family of 4 to spend 20 - 40 extra on water during the day.The extra waste generated is also terrible for the environment. 2. The 'farewell' show at the end of the day was cancelled due to 'heavy rain' (it was barely drizzling), yet the resort failed to even remove the sign advertising the event, meaning we stayed around an extra hour just to be disappointed.",

The eateries, with reduced capacity, also had long queues just to get in. Even the slushee cart had an hour long queue. Only to be told the machine couldnt cope and only 2 unpopular flavour, and even then it had to be made with ice from one machine, and syrup from another. Overall, was there at 11:30 till closing time. Total ride time was no more than 30mins. The rest was spent queuing and walking from point to point. The attraction did not put in any effort to handle capacity crowd while letting in as many people as they possibly could. Waterworld was closed but not boarded up. Looks desolated. Madagascar will also be closed for refresh. Best to avoid until management does a better job at planning.",

And this was my experience even though we followed the staggered timing and planned our route accordingly. The safe distancing measures also don't make any sense at all. Eg. We had to queue for 80mins INDOORS for the 5mins Mummy Returns ride, no social distancing was observed at all in the tunnel. And phones were supposedly not allowed so for that 80mins we just had to entertain ourselves by staring at the wall! Some experienced folks did bring their phones into the queue despite the constant reminders. And then at the end of the queue we saw that the rides could only take 4 passengers each time. That's why we had to breathe down each other's necks for 80mins??? Maybe it's better to just wait till everything goes back to normal...",

I would only recommend going if you have Express tickets though, because it sucks to wait in line in the heat and you lose out on so much fun ride time. If you're weighing up whether to go, I'd recommend installing their app and checking which rides are open and the wait times (if you're not getting Express tickets) a couple days before.

Or having prepaid cards to quickly deduct money, while merely passing over food. For the ice-cream and waffles sales counter, perhaps separate them as waiting for waffles always takes longer, while selling ice-cream is faster.

A few rides and shows were still closed, but the number of visitors didnt limited. There were also corporate customers/ groups who were stopping by at certain rides to take photos to fulfil some game requirements. The general decor and rides were also looking tired and old, and things like King Juliens carousel was old and jerky.

On the day that we went there, the weather was bad and hence, a lot of the outdoor rides were closed. There were a lot of people despite it being a weekday. The lines for some of the rides were long and in the end, over the course of 5 hours we got on only 4 (though to be fair we did have dinner and walked pretty slow in addition to the on and off rain) The souvenir shops were kinda overpriced with 19 for a headband but this is the usual with theme parks. However, the place is beautifully decorated and every location is insta worthy and we took a looooot of pictures. The snacks were also pretty good. The corn dogs and fried chicken were some of my favourites. For a good visit, plan ahead for the weather and the order to visit things. Research on the rides and see which ones you definitely want to do and what you could dk with . You could rush at 6:59 to the more popular rides to skip the queue but the moment the clock turns 7:01 they no longer allow more people. Furthermore, by booking with Kkday (which I did) you get a 10% retail discount voucher, a free ice cream with set meals voucher and a 5 off any individual meal voucher (min 10) . Note: shreks swamp was also removed, which is sad",

The only downside? The waiting time and the queue for the rides (of which, there aren't that many to begin with, so if you come here expecting to ride 10 rollercoasters, nuh uh, not happening).

Cleanliness: leaves at many places/corners. It really look like theres no cleaning regime or the frequency has been reduced. Dirty. an ugly sight. Really. 2. Show, places for visit, attractions: many are closed. U can see from the photo, the food court is closed, the carts are closed mostly, the attractions are closed, some show are cancelled. Really, wonder why they still charged 98 sgd for an adult for this. Things that can be done in uss, reduced tremendously. Not worth the price. 3. Renovation: part of the theme park is closed. As such, the route is a mess. Sign put up for guiding visitors are..... not sure is for confusing the visitors or to help.... They are pointing to... dont know where. Really. I spent a lot of time walking here and there just to go to one place to another. Bad planning. Really. Again, why uss still charge so high if part of the park is renovating...? Puzzled... 4. Generally condition: the place is run down. Attractions, sign, boards.... Many of the Color faded. Need a revamp. 5. Ride experience: feels like the park is design to let visitors wait. For example, the dino flying ride. The poor lady 1 pax need to: (1) start stop the ride, (2) check and scan the express pass (which actually should be checked at the entrance to the queue, but it was done at the entrance to the ride. Waste time), (3) check the visitors exit correctly (waste time), (4) remind visitors to wear mask, cannot split ride... many of these steps can be done parallel, but not possible if it is just 1 staff. Management really need to think what they want the visitors to experience. If the objection is to stall the visitor by letting them queue more, they had succeeded. 6. On covid effort: signs are put up by uss to remind visitors to wear mask when in ride areas. But many visitors did not wear, no staff enforcing this. I guess the sign is for show. The site stated that uss put in enhanced smm, but.... Never implement. The whole afternoon while I was there, I did not see any disinfection done (against what was claimed on the website stating increased cleaning and disinfection. Not sure where did they disinfect. Side track, my recent visit to river safari, the staff disinfect the ride every round. Difficult, but they do what they said. Seriously, after my visit to uss, instead of full peace of mind.. I have full worry of mind. We are living with covid. But it doesnt mean the park can relax to a point that say one thing (Sg clean?), but do another ... Generally, instead of a park that is worth 98sgd per visit, feels more like 18sgd... Can see the staff are friendly. Trying their best. But... gosh, the management need to support the park man..... Sad. Disappointed.",

If they had a few more places to eat open it would have surely alleviated the strain on the other venues. The ride time estimates were completely off, going from 5 minutes to 30 then 60 in a matter of three minutes! If you do decide to go, get the express pass or whatever they call it. While waiting for the Battlestar Galactica ride the wait was 75 minutes for normal park passes while express pass wait was 10 minutes (per the loud speaker time announcements). I've been to other Universal Studios properties and this was the worst experience. Follow Universal Studios Japan's lead, that's the park to emulate. 16 for a cold burger and fries at Mel's.

Much smaller than most other theme parks in the world, but they still manage to pack a decent amount into such a tiny place.

The longest time we waited was 15 minutes, as opposed to the regular queues which went up to as much as 115 minutes. If you can afford it then it will definitely enhance your experience. There was only half of the food and beverage outlets open - which resulted in probably the longest wait Id experienced all day. Took me about 15 minutes to place my order and another 20 to receive it. There are other food/drink carts around the park but these only sell snacks or drinks. Pretty much all shows are still cancelled, including Waterworld. Its obvious the park is not fully operational (pre-covid) yet, but hopefully it gets back to this soon.

They have a few thrilling rides (not for the faint hearted) The place is expensive which is understandable since it caters to tourists. Few of the rides summarised below are a must-do Human Cyclone Transformers Mummy Others cater to the kids. Better to have an express pass if one wants to quit the long queues. Average adult ticket costs around 80 and an express pass costs 20 . We did get a few redeemable vouchers for food , popcorn and souvenirs. Opens at 12 and closes at 7pm. If one doesnt want to do each and every zone( since some are solely for kids) one can easily cover it in one day.",

The rides are nice, but they enforce stupid mask rules for outdoor rides and queues in Singapore weather which was not fun. There are no signs at the door if a place is closed, and I spent a long time walking all the way to a door to try it open when they could have just put a sign on the door to save everyone the steps. Madagascar section is all closed as well and so is waterworld, so limited attraction at the moment. At the end of the day the rides were worth it and thats why I give it a 4/5 star, though things definitely could be better.",

USS is closed on Monday and Tuesday and the operating hours on rest of days are just from 12pm-7pm. We went on weekdays with no any public or school holidays both in Singapore and Malaysia. We were expecting 15min waiting time for each ride but guess what. 130 minutes is the waiting time for both Human and cyclone and 90 minutes for Transformers and minimum 50 minutes for other rides. Imagine going in school holidays..!!! Why the management need to close the park two days in a week and the operating hour also delayed to 12pm when the amount of visitors to the park is still huge???? Is that a strategy to push visitors to buy express pass and multi days pass?? Please do also note that those who purchased the express pass also ended up waiting in queue as hell lot of visitors purchased express pass. Besides, too many eatery outlets are remained closed and visitors needed to wait another long queue to buy foods tooo. All these above said are during extremely non peak and in weekday visit. I can't imagine what it would look like during peak time. Management should look into this matter immediately otherwise they are gonna loose frequent/regular visitors and the good impression towards the park. Wish they would resume operation hours like pre covid where everything went smooth as the number of visitors are high during even non peak weekdays.",

The two main attractions, Human and Cylone, are not really worth it either. Cylone closes at 1 pm, by the way. We went there on a Sunday. Half of everything was closed. Couldn't get a drink within reach. Had to leave family and friends for 15 minutes to get some water. Most rides require that you leave all your belongings in a locker. All. Standing outside for 80 minutes without sunglasses is brutal. You can't even buy a drink because your wallet is locked away. The lockers are free for about 60 minutes. If your line is longer than that, you will have to pay. Some lockers cost about 4 dollars from the start. Why? The ticket money wasn't enough? Not a lot of rides for adults. I would recommend the transformers ride and the one at Jurassic Park. Other than that, there's just a lot of restaurants. It's two stars from me. If you're in Singapore, there are plenty of other great places to go!",

The attractions are rather successful (big plus for the Transformers attraction) even if the waiting times are worthy of Disneyland. You have to buy the fastpass for the day to be profitable but this makes for a very expensive entry for rather limited content. I only tried one fast restaurant there. I was extremely disappointed. The nuggets were of low quality, and the \"hotdog\" that was served to me did not deserve to end its life in my stomach but rather in a trash can. When you visit a culinary city like Singapore, it must be said that you fall from a very high place. It's best to bring your own food or eat at one of the restaurants outside the park. I was entitled to a voucher for popcorns but I was never able to use it... People are so hungry that there are always a lot of people in front of the only popcorn truck in the park.

If you plan to visit during peak season, buy express, it would safe a lot of time. 1 time express side is 70 and unlimited is 100. Each of the ride queue was 40-90 minutes and with express I think it would take 5 minutes queue time only. Ride only open from 2pm but park is opened from 12pm. Not all the facilities open during the time. Most of restaurants and shops are opened already. With safety measure in place, they would leave a gap in between every seat row. Even for carousel ride which I notice it was already at least 1m apart. This contributed to a longer queue time. The timing was not really accurate. One ride, I saw 35 minutes but took me 60 minutes to get on the ride. Also if the queue is longer than the line formed, they would have people there to advice to go back again to visit on another time. Do plan on the visit for the rides, the longest queue is Transformers, it was 90 minutes at all time. The queue started building up around 1pm for 2pm operation, however I think they opened earlier 20 minutes the time I visited. The rest of ride queue will start getting less in the evening time. Restaurants and small shops for redeeming freebies along with the tickets were a long queue. But redemption was quite ok but don't expect to get the same as in the ticket. For me, it was corn dog but I got 5 pcs of nuggets instead. None of the water drinking fountain was on the operation, make sure bring one or buy there. Photo taking with queue and safety distance as well but the queue was formed neatly. Overall, it was quite fun but expect longer queue on the rides due to safety distance measure.",

Staff in the queue at guests services was also rude. Even though I was interrupted by someone who was NOT in the queue, I was told to wait for my turn and that she was seeing to another customer. Hey if you guys can't handle the crowd, then close up. Staff in the guests service area INSIDE the park just after the gantries were really really polite though.

So it can be really frustrating to spend half the time in the park waiting. 3. We got the unlimited ride express pass, and it cut the queueing time down to 10-20mins on average. But yes, you still need to queue up despite spending 90 extra per pax. All rides are shared among regular and express lane ticket holders, it's just that the express lane usually has a shorter queue. 4. You may not actually play all the rides more than once or twice due to time constraints and exhaustion. So it's probably difficult to fully utilize the unlimited express pass. 5.

You can expect queue time of around 1 hr for each of these rides. The queue time will be lesser during evenings. Otherwise you can spend extra to get an express pass to skip the queue. These attractions are the first ones which come up as we walk through Universal Studios and so the queues are also long during the first half of the day. Apart from the above three, canopy flyer was also okay but the duration was too less I felt. The Shrek 4D show (15 mins duration) was some of the best effects I have seen in a 3d movie and worth watching.

Food and drinks within USS are also quite expensive so do bring your own snacks and drinks if you wish. Most rides have free lockers at the side for you to put your bags. One thing is that some staff working within the rides are quite impatient.

You can ask my 7 year old to \"Please stand behind the yellow line for your safety\" in a kind tone, but you don't have to yell at them and me rudely to do the same. Enjoyable place but if this is the culture of how employees deal with guests, you have a big issue. Strongly suggest culture and comms sensitivity and training. It's a competitive post-covid world!

Can not wait, buy express tickets (costly) but even with express ticket, you also need to wait 10-15 mins.

However, to avoid queue, some rides allows Single Person lane which means you won't be with your group so you just be allocated to any random seat in the ride, the queue is very fast. There are some room for improvements: 1. The ticket counter , last lady on the utmost left ( when facing the counters) super short hair, her attitude ?? she rolled her eyes when I asked abt mask wearing, if this is optional, USS should have put a poster to indicate , mask wearing is optional. I am sure there are many people would have asked. She should however be professional to says it's optional, rather than giving me a vague answer. Then when I probed further, she rolled her eyes. 2. The Korean Corn Dog is a cheat, no sight of any protein or meat or mentioned its vegeterian snack . it's crumbed thick Korean rice cake 6 . 3. Lockers , free for first 45mins, I left bag for more than 45mins ,total 10, but I left my bag inside and didn't took my credit card with me.",

Universal had changed their opening hours to Fri to Sun only but neglected to inform ticket holders, so there was a crowd at the gate on Thursday, including a couple with a little boy whose birthday was on that day. It was heartbreaking to see him look so disappointed. The rest of us were angry but remained polite to staff who were explaining how we can change our reservation dates. We had taken days off from work and had come all the way to Sentosa just for the day, only to be let down. Anyway, we changed our date and arrived well and early on our new chosen date. The park opened at 12pm but basically no rides were open except the kiddy Sesame Street ride. They staggered the timings for the opening hours for rides \"due to the pandemic\" but I feel that this is completely stupid because if you only open 1 or 2 rides at 1pm, then everyone in the park will flock to those because there in nothing else to do in the insane heat. Then when the next one opens at 2pm, everyone will go to that one. So basically you're NOT encouraging the social distancing issue. We kept seeing the same people at rides until we decided to go for several rounds on one ride. There was also a family of white people who didn't have their masks on, and staff didn't try to enforce wearing masks until I had to say quite sternly that they should do so. Why are locals so afraid to confront ang mohs? Anyone who is in this country should abide by the rules of this country, regardless of your ethnicity. It's about basic courtesy. Anyway, I will not be visiting Universal again in the day time. This was my first and hopefully last day trip. The only time I will return will be for Halloween Horror Nights.",

I have been to Universal Studio Japan, it was not like this. The price of water is extremely expensive. Over all, they are slow. It took time to change from the guests finished the ride to new coming guests. I liked the ride Mummy. I did not reget to came here but they need some improvements. I prefer Universal Studio Japan in terms of service, ride, and price. You have to keep in your mind that their operation hour is quite short from 12 to 7.",

One concrete example is the \"mist pits\" of the Battlestar Galactica - Cyborg ride. This year there was no mist/water in the pits, and also the two rides (Human and Cyborg) did not start concomitantly, as they used to... so you do not feel the same excitementand and don't get the feeling of being in a battle. This is what i mean with the \"wow effect\". All this besides, it is still a must do activity when in Singapore but i reccomend to invest in the skip the line extra option, because otherwise you will spend all day in long queues, which for some rides can get up to 80 min of waiting time...",

I came to Singapore Universal Studios a lot of times in the past but I can tell their standard has dropped quite a lot. Firstly, the transformers ride broke down not once, but twice! The first time I was in the roller coaster itself when it suddenly stopped working. We had to wait in our seats for a pretty long time (20 minutes)I did not queue too long for the ride because I went for the single rider line but I still waited for about 30 minutes before boarding the ride. There were people beside me that waited up to 100 minutes just for the ride to break down! Luckily the staff gave everyone a one time express ticket that could be used for other rides but honestly, I just wished that the ride was working. The second time happened when we were queuing. We decided to return to give the transformers ride another chance by queuing again. We queued for another 30 mins and right before we could board the ride, an announcement came informing us that the ride broke down AGAIN. We had to leave again disappointed as the transformers ride was one of my favourites. The food choices in USS was also pretty bad. The food tastes mediocre and extremely expensive! I recommend all of you to leave USS and eat at other restaurants that Sentosa has and return after you finished eating. Would not recommend eating in USS itself. Also the Madagascar ride and Waterworld is unavailable as the Madagascar ride is being changed into a minion ride. Waterworld used to be one of my favourite shows in USS but for some reason, they closed it Overall, I am extremely disappointed in USS, which used to be my favourite theme park.",

With at least Waterworld closed, I was still not able to enjoy all the rides I wished to get onto due to the lengthy waiting times. 60mins easily feel like 3hours when you're with an impatient and grumpy 7year old. I missed out on the \"big\" ones( high speed roller coaster etc) which I really wanted to get onto due to their long waiting times of at least 90mins each. The day I went was not a public holiday/Christmas day/New Year's day. Food queues are lengthy as well. With that said, rides/attractions were mostly enjoyable once you get onto them (with a few exceptions). Will I go there soon? No. Did I enjoy myself? Neutral.

Waited 50 min for another Jurassic park ride that lasted maybe 20 seconds. Then we spent over 50 AUD on 4 tiny boxes of fries, 1 single ice cream and 3 coke floats. By 4pm I could not wait another 60 min to go on the large roller coaster. Too jaded by then. I've been to better amusement parks and Waited less time. I wasn't prepared to spend over 700 AUD to have express passes, where even some of those wait times were up to 40 min at some points during the day.

                "review_text": "I don't want to sound mean but there are some things I have to say. The experience of visiting Universal Studios Singapore in 2022 was somewhat poor. I must tell the truth. The main problems are as follows: 1. It is obvious that USSG laid off too many staff at the beginning of the epidemic, and currently the playground is facing a serious staff shortage. The staff lacks training and there is a serious shortage of labor. Although every staff member works hard, their fatigue can be clearly felt. There is no staff to manage the team, and some rides (The Mummy, Galactica, etc.) must be stored, but no one informed them in advance. Staff can only perform management at the project entrance, and there will be no extra staff to maintain order during this period. 2. There are insufficient restaurants, insufficient mobile vendors, insufficient vending machines, and insufficient direct drinking water points. There are too few staff at the catering sales points to serve the large number of tourists, and the speed is very slow, resulting in long queues. 3. The park area is too small and there are too many maintenance projects. Some projects, such as the jeep-riding parent-child project, can be completely stopped. 4. Transformers The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle, a projector was damaged during New Years Day! ! ! ! ! Resulting in dark and heavy shadows in the image. This is a serious performance accident, and it is an irresponsible behavior for the project to continue operating despite such problems! ! ! ! ! ! ! 5. Due to its lack of operational capabilities, Battlestar Galactica completely failed to reflect its design intentions, and it was also an irresponsible behavior towards tourists. One of the selling points of the Battlestar Galactica project is that the two roller coasters stagger forward and backward, which requires the two trains to cooperate in the departure time, but currently due to lack of manpower, this has not been reflected at all. 6. The useless Fast Pass. The official website states that the pass is only valid for 2 hours after the start of operation, but there is no time limit on actual sale and use, and unclear information can cause many problems. At the same time, not all Fast Pass locations can be used, and the sales quantity is not controlled. At certain times, there may be more Fast Pass players than normal queue players. 7. The attitude of the restaurant staff is extremely bad. There is no one to manage the queue. The staff who pre-registered the order made a driving gesture to us for no reason, intending to make us go to another queue. This is extremely insulting and reflects the extremely low level of park management, because I believe the staffs intention is not to insult tourists but they are obviously not trained. 8. The store SKU is too old and all IPs are not competitive. If the selling point of usj Japan is Harry Potter, then ussg has no idea. 9. The maintenance time of Water World is too long, and it has not been repaired for how long. It took such a long time to repair a project in such a large area in such a small park. 10. Entry into the park was also quite chaotic. Tourists queued up spontaneously at first without any guidance from staff, but in the end, the number of queues became more than a dozen, and no one guided the queue in advance. US SG's evaluation should be benchmarked against amusement parks. If usj's overall evaluation is 5 points, then ussg can only score 3 points, which is too much. If Tokyo Disney has an overall score of 5, then ussg can only give 2 points. Tourists and staff are full of fatigue. The operational level of ussg is not comparable to that of Happy Valley. I think it is a pity. For the Chinese, most of the first batch of Chinese people to learn modern management knowledge came through the window of Singapore, but I dont know why the current management is like this.",

With limited operating hours of only 11:00-18:00 outside of peak season, you're at a steep disadvantage in terms of being able to enjoy very many attractions unless you buy the express pass. You cannot conceivably ride even half of the rides without the express pass. I also felt that some aspects of our visit were purposefully stacked against us. Despite a short queue, there was a bizarrely long wait at the concession stand in Jurassic Park - over a half hour to filter through maybe ten people placing orders. After that long wait, the attendant at the entrance to the neighbouring Canopy Flyer was refusing to allow people to bring drinks into the queue, despite the 60-minute wait for that ride and two trash cans full of drink cups at the midpoint and end of that queue - which means either people were sneaking drinks into queue or this woman was just being particularly cruel. It would have been nice to enjoy my drink for at least some of that wait instead of wasting time outside. It was also very hard to buy tickets in advance as a non-local. The official website refused every Visa, MasterCard, and Amex we have, they unbelievably have no phone contact centre, and their online support asks you to send credit card information through email! We eventually found tickets on the Singapore site of Trip dot com - and for cheaper, too. It was fun to come once, but likely won't come again.",

The park is lovingly designed and offers primarily moderately fast to fast-paced roller coasters. Don't expect the park to be the same as any other park (e.g. Europapark, that shouldn't be the expectation, that's what the great film themes are for here) and you'll have a lot of fun. Tips: - Check waiting times in the app. - Be there and run at least 30 minutes before the park opens. Then you can ride several trains directly without waiting in line. - You can refill your drinking water for free in the park. We were also allowed to bring food with us. - The lockers in the park are rented under different conditions. Some cost directly, others are free for the first 45 minutes and 90 minutes in the afternoon. Just try it out. We never had to pay for our lockers.",

I really dislike their system with the Universal Express tickets. Not only because you make people willing/able to spend more money more important, it also slows down the whole process as the staff first need to check those tickets, mark them, count the people they let in first before allowing the normal people waiting in line... it annoyed me more and more during the day. I know I can complain but there are a lot of people with enough money, seeing the number of people using it, so they never going to change this system We didn't see a lot of the rest of the park because there was no time for it. So spend your time wisely. We really liked the Battlestar Galactica, the Mummy and the Shrek movie.",

I bought the ticket via Klook in advance with USD 61/adult & USD 45/child. But can you imagine that I & my daughter sister could play only 2 Rides due to temporarily closed others??? Universal Studio Singapore has temporarily closed many Rides thought its Sunday (a crowded day of visiting) such as Water World show, Treasure Hunters, Enchanted Airways, Madagascar, Magic Potion Spin. Therefore, may I ask 61/adult that I paid just for 2 RIDES? Do you all think its worth? If you closed many rides like that you should change/discount the ticket price instead. SAME AS MY VISITING OF UNIVERSAL STUDIO HOLLYWOOD (on Oct22) Finally, this was my last time to visit the Universal Studio Singapore and do not recommend to my friends for sure.",

We wanted to buy the fast pass but the quota of the day ran off so we couldn't. There was quite the discrimination between the pass holder and the 'peasants' especially at the transformer ride. The staff is very rude and allowing all the fast pass riders to ride EVERY TIME. I que at the single riders and she won't even allow me enter the ride even though there was 2 empty seats several times. She insisted to allow the fast pass or the group que to fill in the seat. Then what is the point of the single riders?? Glad that the other ride staff are not like the transformer. The fast pass also has a que even though is very little. BUT gives the 'peasants' chances too. If you enjoy rides BUY THE FAST PASS. The price is 100USD but worth it. Who has time to wait 2 hours for a single ride right? And on the shrek movie. From 200 people, why must it be our chair that is not moving , it only move the first time but it stopped. It's not even the stationary chair . It used to be very fun going here The que system had to be improved or not it will be hell for non fast pass riders. I don't think my last visit worth the money. I could only enjoy 3 attraction despite going there from 11 am to 6 pm because of the long que (shrek, transformer, human). Definitely regret not buying the fast pass online.",

When we went the entire waterworld section was closed, which was a huge disappointment for the kids. The rides are great but have extremely long waiting lines on most days exceeding 120 minutes which is impractical and frustrating for a 2 minute ride. Some of the shows like Shrek 4D and Steven Spielberg Presents have a 10-15 minute intro before the actual show without any seating. The most important issue I saw was that all the eateries close along with the park timings, which is extremely frustrating because after an entire day at the rides you are very hungry and there's nowhere to eat after the rides close. The photos clicked by the automatic cameras on the rides are not great and not positioned at a good angle.",

The park is quite small, and the entrance fee is quite expensive, especially considering the limited number of attractions. Even on a Monday outside of the school holidays, the wait times for all the rides were long, ranging from 50 to 120 minutes. One major issue I noticed was the poor maintenance of the park. The exterior paintwork was faded, and many attractions had broken elements, from minor things like malfunctioning TV screens in the queues to more significant issues like the broken robot dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park ride. Furthermore, all the attractions in this park felt like inferior versions of similar rides in other parks worldwide. It seemed like little effort was made to provide something unique. Additionally, the toilets were unclean, and the food was expensive. The staff seemed to put minimal effort into ensuring efficient queue management. Platforms were overcrowded, and the staff was unfriendly on multiple occasions. It felt like they were simply going through the motions. One aspect that added to the frustration was the necessity to purchase an express pass. The regular queue lines moved at an excruciatingly slow pace, making it feel almost mandatory to buy an express pass to avoid spending the entire day waiting in line. Overall, I got the impression that little attention was given to visitor experience. Hopefully, the park can make improvements in the future to meet visitor expectations and enhance the overall quality of attractions and service.

This is assuming that they don't even take time for meals at all. The app wasn't accurate as well - we went to queue for a ride that said 20 min wait, but halfway into the queue, the physical signboard was changed to say 50 min while the app still said 20 min. Mel drive in burger only was 16 bucks but some Mcdonald gourmet burgers are bigger, juicier and better. And there were only 4 selection of burgers, a terribly limited menu. The pizza place was selling a large pizza at 50 bucks!!! I get that food in there is expensive, but it has gone ridiculously off the chart. Did we enjoy it? My girl who leveraged on the single rider lanes whenever they were opened went a few times on certain rides. But it wasn't possible to be able to experience everything. She was happy, but to me who's seen the park during the hey days with more rides yet somehow more time to cover most attractions, and food that were already expensive but still had some standards back then... nah, I think there are better places to spend the money. This was on a Thursday, school holiday yes but surprisingly, more tourists than locals.

You cannot enjoy whole park then unless you are having express entry for which you need to cough out 10000 extra per person apart from entry tickets .

I think I saw more people come out than go in for the ride. It felt very unprofessional and what about the elderly? This place is good but their prices are exorbitant and they charge more for express rides to get to rides faster but that queue is also pretty long. Waiting a long time for rides that are 5 to 10 minutes or even less is very time consuming. Now coming to the parts I did enjoy, the mummy ride was incredible. It was an indoor roller coaster ride. I liked the details put into the ride from the mummy movies. It would have been 5 stars if the queue was significantly shorter. Recommended if you want to experience this place and you can buy the express tickets. If not, it is pretty much impossible to explore most of the rides. If we wait too long for one ride, we can't explore the others.",

                "review_text": "Without a doubt, of all the parks I have visited, this has been the worst in its classification as an experience. Negatives: -Up to more than 2 hours to get on an attraction. -Few bathrooms. You can pee waiting to get on an attraction. -The shows are poor and a bit boring. -Junk food and very expensive. Nor do they offer hardly any healthy food. -The park is not too big. -The park gets boring every time you have to wait. -Tremendous sounds from the expanding minions construction. -The operation of the lockers in some attraction creates a queue instead of making it simple and speeding up the process. -It closes too early and even if you go very early you will have a lot of waiting to get on the attractions. Even the simplest. -Too many people. The amount of people inside the park is overwhelming. -Bad organization by the park management. -Little variety of attractions and a bit old. -The que on after close park to take train its so long. Positive aspects: -The park is decently well-kept and there is no trash on the ground. -It is very easy to navigate. -If you like photography, it offers beautiful views with all the props and decorations. -The design of the park is beautiful. -The pets for kids. -Variety stores. In summary: I do not recommend visiting this park for the price of admission at the moment. It' boring cuz you have to wait a lot and everything is very slow. The shows are not good enough. Recommendations: -They should give a wake-up call to the entire management responsible for the park. It has many things to improve. -Its a bit scam to pay and not be able to enjoy. You can feel a bit frustrated or angry. -The number of people per day must be less so that the waiting lists at the attractions are not so long, although that means having to reserve the ticket time before. -The express pass is too expensive, 88 normal prize express (more than 100) so its around 200 each. Better separate the normal prize and the express. -Lower the price of food and improve the quality of food. -This park should add Singapour part that represent the culture and history of the country with nice rides and shows about country. I don't recommend waste your money in this park if you have in your priority list. July 2023.",

                "review_text": "I recently visited Universal Studios in Singapore with my family and close family members with high hopes of an unforgettable day filled with excitement and adventure. Unfortunately, my experience was marred by one glaring issue: the absurdly long queues. It's disheartening to say that my overall impression of Universal Studios was one of frustration and disappointment. Upon arrival, it was immediately evident that the park was overcrowded. The lines for popular attractions stretched endlessly, resembling a never-ending labyrinth of waiting. It felt like the park management had completely overlooked the importance of efficient crowd control and guest satisfaction. Even with a carefully planned itinerary, I found myself spending the majority of my time (more than one or 2 hours)standing in lines rather than enjoying the attractions. It was disheartening to see families and children growing increasingly tired and restless while waiting for their turn, dampening the excitement that should have been synonymous with a theme park visit. To make matters worse, the queuing experience was poorly managed, resulting in excessive wait times that far exceeded any reasonable expectation. I understand that popular attractions will naturally attract larger crowds, but the sheer lack of organization and inefficiency at Universal Studios was astounding. As a paying customer, I expected a more seamless experience. I had eagerly anticipated immersing myself in the magical world of Universal Studios, but instead, I spent most of my time standing in line, growing increasingly disillusioned by the minute. I sincerely hope that Universal Studios addresses this significant issue and takes steps to improve their crowd management system. The park's reputation and the satisfaction of its visitors are at stake. Until then, I cannot recommend Universal Studios to anyone seeking a hassle-free and enjoyable theme park experience. In conclusion, my visit to Universal Studios was marred by interminable queues, overcrowding, and a lack of organization. The park failed to deliver on its promise of a thrilling and magical adventure, leaving me and my family with a sense of regret and frustration. Unless significant improvements are made, I would caution others against wasting their time and money at Universal Studios.",

It was hot & humid in the queuing areas with a very few fans and people were literally dying of heat ! The park should limit the number of people allowed so everyone can enjoy who has paid this much amount to get a ticket. The people with express ticket obv had an edge at the expense of people with regular tickets, but the express ticket prices are ridiculous ! We were only able to get on 2-3 rides in the whole day and kids were exhausted and bored due to long queues. Many food courts were closed and the ones that were available had average food, out of stock and priced at a level of fine dine ! It was supposed to be a fun day but turned out to be a torture !",

We managed to go on a Saturday morning arriving shortly after 11 am, which is the opening time. The first attraction we went to was Transformers: The Ride. By the one-hour mark we noticed that the closer we got, the further we actually were. By the two-hour mark we noticed the people ahead of us were leaving, and we followed since there was still a long line ahead. I saw kids sitting on the floor waiting in the queue. Some were napping in their parents arms. For a \"family-friendly\" you would expect a better arrangement for children. When we left we saw that most rides had a long queue of one hour. We finally found a short rollercoaster ride with a waiting time of 20 minutes. It is such a disappointment that an 80 SGD ticket got us on one ride, and an express ticket would be an additional 100 or so. By the time we wanted an express ticket, they were sold out. So by 4 pm, we only managed one ride. Universal studios is a beautiful space. If you want to just walk around, then this is the place for you. If you want to hop on rides, splurge on an express ticket.",

Imagine waiting 120 minutes to sit in a ride of 60 seconds! *The express tickets are not worth it at all. *If you are with the kids, the height issues will not allow you to enjoy all rides. * Food is over rated and too heavy on the pocket. *Struggle to find route to the universal studio if you are not taking Sentosa express, as there are no sign boards to help you through. * As Singapore is very hot especially in summers, they could arrange some system to provide relief from the heat when they have shows in an enclosure, like in the Shrek show. *What is the purpose of a few rides like treasure hunt is a mystery. Utter waste of time.",

Picked up express single use passes in morning and there was surge pricing at 90 a ticket. (Was 70 a few days earlier). Went on about 7 rides, and altho we did manage to save a lot of time in queues, wasn't sure is it's worth that kind of premium. I think maybe 50 is more reasonable for the single use express and maybe double that foe the unlimited as I don't see how they police it from being shared around groups of friends. Didn't see a single character all day. And it bucketed down in rain 3 times for extended periods. We got soaking wet. Even after buying an umbrella there. There is some cute merchandise at the shops. The meals we had there is at least double the cost of normal restaurants outside and not very tasty. Was it fun yes. But it is an expensive day out. It is also super hot. Well singapore is in general. Guess the rain was good for cooling it down. The metro line to get out of sentosa was super long as well if u leave around park close.",

                "review_text": "Rating: I recently visited Universal Studios Singapore with high hopes for an exciting and memorable day. However, my experience left much to be desired. Despite purchasing express tickets to expedite entry, the reality was far from what I expected. My visit began at 11:30 AM, right after the park's opening at 11:00 AM. With a limited operating window of 7 hours (11:00 AM to 6:00 PM), I anticipated being able to enjoy a significant number of attractions. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The express tickets, which I paid an additional 90 Singaporean dollars for, were meant to reduce wait times. Regrettably, they did little to alleviate the problem. The queues for express ticketholders were disappointingly long, often resulting in wait times that rivaled those of the regular lines. This defeated the purpose of investing in express tickets and left me feeling frustrated. Out of the 15-18 attractions available, I was able to experience only 4-5 due to the time constraints and the extensive wait times. Spending over an hour in line for just one attraction felt like a waste of both time and money. With only 7 hours to explore the park, it's clear that Universal Studios Singapore needs to prioritize queue management and optimize the use of express tickets to ensure that visitors can make the most of their time. While the park's ambiance and themed areas were impressive, the overall experience was marred by the operational issues. It's evident that the current approach to managing crowds and queue times needs a major overhaul. I hope that Universal Studios Singapore takes this feedback seriously and takes steps to improve the visitor experience, especially for those who have invested in express tickets. In conclusion, my visit to Universal Studios Singapore fell far short of expectations. The limited operating hours, inadequate queue management, and ineffective use of express tickets resulted in a day that was more frustrating than enjoyable. As a visitor who paid extra for a seamless experience, I can't help but feel disappointed by how things turned out.",

They opened at 11am. We were there a few minutes past 11 and immediately went to the cyclon and human rides. Both were being tested and no assurance was given of being able to ride either. We went to transformers, it was closed. We then lined up for the Mummy and had to wait 100 minutes to get our ride. The ride itself was nice and exhilarating. The lonnnnnggggg wait was not. Cyclon and human were open by the time we finished the mummy but the waiting time was 2 hours! Single riders was not entertained either. No way! We were able to get to a jurassic ride, lights show, and then water world. Obviously, we wanted to experience more but the queueing time is such a downer. Had lunch in between. The hot weather does not help with the mood. They used to have water sprays back then. On our way out, we saw Panda mascot needing to be washed. For the price paid, the Universal Studio experience itself was a huge disappointment. It even failed to excite me to shop. Testing of rides should have been done before opening. Unavailable rides are also upsetting. Sadly, I'm most likely not coming back; nor am I likely to recommend this place.

Food choices should be more catering to the vast tourist population. One can't complete visiting all rides and places because the offer Express entry on paying extra (so preferential treatment to the affordable). They distinguish tourists into different classes which I personally don't appreciate. Some rides are dangerous so personal discretion is advised. The Shrek was a waste and needs to be replaced with something more attractive. More than 50 percent of the crowd wanted to be out in less than a minute and opened the emergency exits to get out.

We bought tickets at the train station going to sentosa island. Got lined up at the gates, 1hr goes by and we're told these aren't tickets to enter, they're tickets to get entry tickets so we had to line up at a different place again for about 1hr.

I was fine with the idea of spending a whole day at the park, but the queues for the rides were just unrealistic. 150 minutes for Cylon, 120 minutes for transformers, 100 minutes for revenge of the mummy and 60 minutes for both canopy flyer and rapids adventure. The express pass is an ABSOLUTE MUST to get anywhere near doing these rides in one day especially as the park is only open from 11-6.

Battlestar Galactica (cylon side), Jurassic Park (way better version than U.S. parks), and Puss N Boots. This park would get a higher mark, except they are TERRIBLY inefficient at ride loading. Battlestar Galactica was a painful wait (even with the express pass) because they only used one train. Even with an express pass, while the standby line was at 70 minutes, it still took 30 minutes. Its baffling to have one train on a popular coaster. I feel like this is done on purpose to upsell people on the express pass. Its made worse by lack of staff and a good 6-8 minutes between groups. At 16 people per ride, thats quite a large chunk of time to get through a queue that typically has 30 people queued in each line as they alternate filling a train from each line. Meanwhile, the Mummy with a 5 minute wait, had many more ride staff. They really ought to shift more resources from less popular rides to the more popular. You cant depend on the displayed wait times. They are NOT reliable. A ride with 30 minutes displayed was walk on. Another ride with 25 minutes displayed took 40. A ride with 5 minutes displayed took 15. Another ride with 25 minutes displayed was walk-on. Obviously Im not made at surprise walk on rides, but for people trying to plan their day and pack in as much as they can, reliable advertised wait times is the only way to do that. The food in the park is better than any food Ive seen at ANY theme park, except maybe DisneySea/Land in Tokyo. The park was also only open for 7 hours. Soon to be just 6 hours. Thats bizarre for a theme park and really makes you have to plan carefully if you want to fit it all in.",

The attention to detail and immersive experience truly brought the Transformers world to life. On the positive side, the park's themed zones were brilliantly designed, immersing visitors in different universes, from Hollywood to Sci-Fi City. The entertainment shows and live performances were engaging, adding to the overall festive atmosphere. Additionally, the convenience of booking tickets online and utilizing the express counter significantly reduced waiting times, ensuring more time to enjoy the attractions. However, the only downside was the occasional long queues, which is quite common for popular attractions. To make the most of your visit, I highly recommend booking tickets online in advance and opting for the express counter to bypass long queues. This allows you to maximize your time and enjoy a seamless experience at Universal Studios. Overall, a thrilling adventure that's perfect for fans of movies and theme park enthusiasts alike!",

A few tips to all the people who are going there: 1. If you are going to play the Transformers Galactica roller coaster, go line up at once. I had to line up for 90 minutes even if I went there first. 2. Check if the rides require you to store your bag into the lockers. You have to requeue if you have to put your bags in the locker. 3. The queue for Revenge of the Mummy is very quick in later hours as there are multiple cars. 4. For all the lone wolves going to the USS alone, check if there's a single-rider line. As I went there alone, I saved a lot of time queuing. 5. Download the USS app. It is very helpful as it has a map and all the wait time. 6. Eating lunch in the Malaysian food court is quite cheap, so if you want to save money, consider going there. I was a bit disappointed as the Transformer 3D ride had an error and was closed when I went there. I wasn't able to play that. But overall my experience in there is quite good, and the staff are helpful and enthusiastic.",

As such, they had changed It's timing to 10am - 5 pm so that it could sell separate tickets for Halloween of the same park from 6 pm. There are only about 15 rides including children's rides as such queue for each ride was huge. The average waiting time for each ride was nearly 60 minutes for general tickets (costing about 5,000/- INR) and 20 minutes for express pass (about 10k INR). The ride time was between 40 seconds to 2 minutes max. So we had to wait for an hour for a minute long ride. By 5:30 pm the staff started forcing people who didn't have Halloween tickets out of the park. Their entire focus was only on money unlike rest of singapore. Would never visit again.",

Compared to the past where the left side of the park had Madagascar etc, now that entire part of the theme park is closed for development of Minion land. Easily 1/3 of the park closed up? And many shows were available like twice a day only and if u miss those timings then too bad for u. So end up u miss many shows and miss the 1/3 of the park, and I dont see the ticket prices being reduced by 1/3 the usual. Note last time Covid they closed the Shrek 4D show. Now its still closed. Used to go a restaurant just opposite Jurassic land. Food was quite good. I think discovery something. It was closed too! And as u walk everywhere in the theme park, many wagons/stalls were closed too. And sgp weather is scorching hot, every queue is minimally 30 min long on a Friday. PLEASE DONT WASTE MONEY BUYING ICE CREAM THERE. Within 5 seconds of buying your ice-cream, its already 1/4 melted and dripping down your hands. Within half min, I can say its a terribly messy sight and mood dampener. Buy ice cream if you want to spoil your day and stain your clothes. Walking around u can see frowns on everyones faces due to the heat and many staff wore frowns on their foreheads plus giving a rude and cold attitude. Oh please. How do u expect guests to enjoy if most of your staff look so grumpy.... I dont mean all staff though. Some were nice and friendly but really only a few in numbers. Overall, I wont go back unless there is 1/3 price reduction until the minion land opens and all the attractions/shows and stalls/restaurants open. Then I think its justifiable. P.S. standards of toilets are a far cry from what you can see in Tokyo Disneyland although Tokyo Disneyland is much older than USS.",

One of the main demerit is in studios half of the potions are closed for under renovation Here's a breakdown of my review: 1. **Rides and Attractions (4/5):** The park boasts a wide variety of rides and attractions that cater to all age groups. I particularly enjoyed the thrilling roller coasters and immersive 3D experiences. However, some rides had long wait times, which can be a bit frustrating. 2. **Entertainment (4/5):** The live shows and performances were a highlight of my visit. The Waterworld show was especially impressive, with its stunts and special effects. The only downside was that show timings could be a bit inflexible. 3. **Theming and Atmosphere (4/5):** Universal Studios Singapore excels in creating a vibrant and engaging atmosphere. The attention to detail in the park's design is commendable, making you feel like you've stepped into another world. However, at times, it felt overcrowded, especially in popular areas. 4. **Food and Dining (3/5):** While there are numerous dining options, I found the food to be relatively expensive for the quality. It would be great to see more affordable and diverse food choices. 5. **Staff (5/5):** The staff at Universal Studios Singapore were incredibly friendly and helpful. They added to the overall positive experience and were always ready to assist with any questions or concerns. 6. **Value for Money (4/5):** Considering the entertainment and attractions offered, the ticket price is reasonable. However, additional costs for food and merchandise can add up quickly. In summary, my visit to Universal Studios Singapore was enjoyable, with thrilling rides, great entertainment, and friendly staff. While there is room for improvement in terms of dining options and crowd management, it's a fantastic destination for families and thrill-seekers alike. I'd give it a solid 4 stars out of 5.",

I would assume the staff being Singaporean would have been be better educated. it really shames me being a Singaporean. what happens to \"Excuse me Sir/Mdm\"? the 1 ride that really piss me, was at Sesame street, apparently there's a booster seat on 1 of the back row seat of the cart, i try to remove it, unaware that i wasn't suppose to do so . no staff usher me to the cart nor advised me not to do so. then 1 of the attending staff, tall, lanky and bespectacled , actually told me off in a stern and rude manner\" don't remove it!, don't touch that, move to the front row\". i'm old enough to be his dad, where's the basic courtesy? Management of Universal Studio, you seriously have to relook at the coaching of the staff. On a general note, I observed that 70% of the staff displayed poor customer service. They portrayed a aura of being disgruntled and have no sense of belonging to Universal Studio. I feel really bad as a Singaporean as this isn't the Singapore experience that I would like our foreign visitors to witness. Genting RWS, I understand that you are expanding but before that, pehaps relook to the education of the staff and more walking of the gound by management. 2 stars for the remaining staff which didn't makes it a total disappointment for my family and me.",

The themes and activities were very well planned, and as parents, my partner I were impressed with everything there was to see and do for us and our 3-year-old. However, the relentless humidity and heat made waiting in the long queues quite unpleasant. On a positive note, the staff were excellent and very helpful; we didn't encounter any unhelpful staff throughout the park. Our biggest disappointment came when we tried to grab some food. Unfortunately, all the food outlets had a technical issue and couldn't accept card payments. We didn't have any cash on hand, and without food, both our toddler and we couldn't fully enjoy all the rides and attractions. It's disheartening to know that a massive establishment like Universal Studios couldn't resolve a technical issue or organize an alternative for its visitors. At this point, I'm not sure if we'll be returning. It's frustrating that such an issue could significantly impact our experience. I hope that Universal Studios Singapore takes steps to address these kinds of technical glitches in the future to provide a more seamless and enjoyable experience for its visitors.",

What was disappointing is the food - relatively expensive, poor choice, bad quality. Soft ice cream was crunchy because it's over frozen. Overall eating here felt like rip off. Another big issue (might be local specifics, since we met similar problem at the hotel) are visitors. Around 60% of them belong to specific group that probably got to the park on a donkey straight from their remote village. Meaning they do not understand personal space, queues and personal hygiene. I personally get annoyed being around such type of people, but might be my personal view. So probably overall if you approach it smart - eat a lot before, take some snacks and go to attractions early or before closure, it could be a great experience.

I especially like the Revenge of the Mummy and the Human/Cylon rollercoasters. You need to empty your pockets for those rides and there are nearby lockers that are free for 90 minutes. Overall, I like Universal Studios Singapore, but mostly go here because of a lack of options in the area. This park is nicer than Legoland Malaysia, but also quite a bit more expensive. Our annual passes for Legoland expired recently, but at some point we're going to sign up again and probably won't visit Universal Studios until those passes expire again.

But we were disappointed that almost all the meet & greets were cancelled due to the rain. If we as guests are supposed to continue around the park, why cant the park live up to the same? We do not expect a refund, but paying for entry plus express tickets doesnt seem worth if we dont get to experience the parks attractions in its entirety. Furthermore, we paid 70 for unlimited soft copies of our pictures taken around the park. We were encouraged to pay earlier for ease of collection at the end of the day. To our horror, half of the pictures we took around the park was not given to us! The kids were so disappointed as their pictures with the transformer robots are missing! To add to it all, the customer service is horrible. First your staff was rude to us, and dared to use the excuse that this is how Singaporeans talk. We are Singaporean ourselves and we completely disagree with such a statement. Emails go unanswered and theres no contact number for us to request for our pictures which we have PAID for. Utterly disappointed.",

To my disappointment, the visit to the park was horrible, the first ride I queued for almost 2 hours, when I got close, I saw that the instructors weren't filling the carts, letting it go empty, without 2 or 3 people... Total negligence with whoever was in line... When leaving I thought about buying the fast-pass, when I went to buy it it started raining, and the park was closed for a whole 3 hours, no rides were working anymore. After 1 hour with nothing to do, a waterworld show was about to start and we decided to watch it, to our surprise, right at the beginning of the show, an employee had an accident and the show was canceled and they told us to leave the place... As if that wasn't enough, I went to try to buy an ice cream, I was the first in line, and I only went close to the counter to the side to look at the flavors, to get started and the attendant was super rude to me saying that I was missing the line, I I tried to explain what happened to him, he didn't even want to listen to me, super ignorant. I was so upset with everything about the park, service, attractions, lack of preparation of the staff... Anyway, I didn't like it and I don't recommend it...",

I'd gone on a Wednesday so there was a huge crowd therefore long queues for each game hence I couldn't sit for any ride or watch the Hollywood horror show. Later around 1.30pm it rained so all rides were closed. Vegetarian food is not available easily, there's one place with potato wedges n the like near the Ancient Egypt section...but no proper food. That was an issue coz it's far from the games section. I walked around to Jurassic park, Water World etc, and started walking towards the exit. My shoes n socks got wet. I couldn't sit anywhere coz of the rains and my legs were paining at the end of the day having done 10k steps in the studios. Suggestions - - Give Senior citizens ticket concessions as they can't use rides but the studios is worth watching. - Veg restaurants should be marked on the studio app for accessibility. - Provisions for selling umbrellas, caps, shoe covers/rubber flip flops should be available in more parts of the studios.",

For food, the Malaysian food court on the right after exiting the USS may be a little cheaper and better. There is also a manned counter on the right side as you enter, so you can pay with cash. Also, I was able to buy the tickets a little cheaper because I paid with a coupon or PayPal, which is recommended for advance purchase.

But the service is quite bad. We were there on a very slow day, with most of the park empty, and the Battlestar Galactica coasters were operating with only one train - which brought waiting time to 30, 40 minutes when the other attractions had a maximum waiting time of 10. Felt like they were slowing down operations to sell more Express Passes. Service is very slow in restaurants as well, and most photo stands for the attractions were not working. Theres also no nighttime show, neither a lot of street entertainment. The major show in the park - Waterworld - happens once a day only. Its the smallest Universal park in the world, and it couldve been so much better if operations were good, and if there was more entertainment and showtimes.",

                "review_text": "Mixed Experience at Universal Studios Singapore I recently visited Universal Studios Singapore, and while the overall experience was enjoyable, there were a few drawbacks that need attention. I would recommend everyone to get the tickets via their website as it offers 1 hour early access. The park offers a thrilling array of rides and attractions, creating a captivating atmosphere for visitors. However, my excitement took an unexpected turn when we got stuck on one of the rides (the Transformers). The staff kept us updated and we were given an express pass as compensation. This hiccup slightly dampened the experience, highlighting a need for better maintenance and operational efficiency. Another ride went again into maintenance after we reached the front of the queue after waiting half n hour, another disappointment (The chase of the mummy) On the culinary front, the variety of food options was commendable, but I couldn't ignore the steep prices. The expensive food choices were a drawback, making it less budget-friendly for visitors. It would be beneficial for the park management to reconsider pricing strategies to enhance the overall value for guests. Additionally, while most staff members were helpful, I encountered instances where a bit more politeness could have made a difference. Improving staff interactions would undoubtedly contribute to a more positive and memorable visitor experience. In conclusion, Universal Studios Singapore offers a fantastic time with its attractions, but addressing issues like ride maintenance, food pricing, and staff politeness would elevate the overall guest satisfaction.",

                "review_text": "We went for an impromptu visit to Universal Studios Singapore and had already expected a high crowd as it was a day before Christmas. The overall experience at Universal Studios Singapore was a mix of excitement and frustration. Despite the thrilling rides and attractions, - ticket prices were jaw-breaking expensive, costing almost 200 for 2 adults and 1 child - dining experience was hectic with long queues and limited seats especially over at Mel's Drive. This made it challenging for us to enjoy a relaxed meal with our kids. Restaurants could have offered food with various texture suitable for all ages (e.g. porridge) to enhance its family-friendly atmosphere. Food and drinks are also outrageously pricey (which is expected). - push carts could have offered a wider range of halal food options to accommodate a more diverse visitor base with various dietary preferences. - there were significant wait times for the rides/ shows. Additionally, lack of child-friendly activities, limiting options for families with younger children. - outcome of the photo-taking at \"Sci-Fi City\" with \"Optimus Prime\" was a disappointment as the image turned out to be dark. The low visibility at night hindered the clarity of the photo and this was captured using both our phone and even with their camera. - restrooms appeared to be inadequately maintained, with dirty toilet cubicles and lack of toilet paper. - drying pod can be too warm for tall people (could have indicate a sign outside to warn users of the heat they might expect upon use). Nonetheless, it was still a memorable experience for us as we did not hold any expectations on experiencing the rides and shows with the high crowd (which finally settled down late afternoon). We were impressed that: - there was a prayer space provided for Muslims, - almost every attraction has a water cooler, - the performances were energetic and lively, - there was good crowd control for character meet-and-greet. We hope this feedback can contribute to improvements in the overall experience at Universal Studios Singapore and we also hope to see a more variety of shows and activities suitable for various age groups.",

Securing the one-hour early entry ticket (9 AM) was a game-changer, allowing me to explore at least five attractions before the crowds descendeda practical and cost-effective choice compared to the pricier express ticket. While most of the rides boasted minimal wait times, a brief snarl at Battlestar Galactica added an unexpected twist. A croc slipper mishap caused a 30-minute delay, turning a 10-minute wait into 40 minutes. However, this hiccup aside, the majority of attractions featured wait times ranging from 5 to 40 minutes, depending on the time of day. The WaterWorld show, a captivating spectacle, became a highlight of the day with two performances, and catching the 1:30 PM show proved to be a rewarding choice. The Jurassic Park area offered a culinary respite, though prices were steepa common theme in amusement parks. Despite the cost, the food was delectable, living up to the \"amusement park pricing\" standard. In retrospect, my early entry strategy, coupled with the occasional waits and memorable shows, made the day at Universal Studios Singapore an unforgettable experiencea journey through cinematic magic and thrills.",

                "review_text": "As someone who has visited many theme parks around the world and most of the Universal sites worldwide Universal Singapore operates like no other theme park and not in a good way. The biggest issue here is how the rides operate with regards to lockers. In order to ride some of the rides they do not allow you to have anything in your pockets at all. This is very different to every other theme park I've been to where they understandably don't allow bags or backpacks so you have to use the lockers but items in your pockets are allowed everywhere else but here. The first problem is they do not make this clear when you are queuing so when you get to the front of the queue and are scanned by a metal detector wand it detects your phone / wallet etc. and you are told by the miserable staff member that you need to put this in a locker despite having already queued and dropped your bag off at the locker before joining the ride queue. They do allow you to return to the front of the queue but this could be avoided by having someone inform the visitors while they queue. So once you have placed everything you carry into a locker you then queue for the ride. Sounds ok, right? Wrong. The lockers are only free for a set amount of time (45 mins) which if you are a theme park regular you will know is nowhere near enough time to queue for a ride so you then get charged a rate of 2 for every 10 mins past the free 45 mins. A complete scam. For context Universal Florida give you a few hours free. If you aren't already annoyed at your experience so far once you get off the ride to collect you items you then discover that you do not have your bank cards to pay for the locker as they are locked away so you now have to find an employee who can unlock your items for you and then you have to pay them in cash which not everyone will have so you then need to go find some cash. It's infuriating and such a colossal waste of valuable time in the park. After 1 ride I'm so angry at the entire situation and genuinely don't want to be there anymore. Ride staff are miserable and extremely unhelpful throughout the day. For contrast the staff in the retail stores are very friendly and helpful. Maybe this is better training, maybe it's working environment (air con) staff in restaurants were a mixed bag. Some were friendly, some were just rude. Food in the park was actually pretty good and unlike other theme parks wasn't ridiculously expensive. We bought tickets that included a Chinese New Year promo meal which meant each area of the park offered a different option for this so it's worth shopping around to find the best looking meal. We opted for duck wraps from the Shrek themed area and they were very large and delicious. Had we known portion size we would have used one voucher here and bought something else from another area. Not all the food was good though. In Mel's Diner from back to the future I ordered a sundae that was a half filled cup of semi melted ice cream and not the swirled ice cream with strawberry sauce as pictured (see pics). When we complained about this to staff in both English and Chinese (my wife is Malaysian Chinese) they just laughed and walked away. Wait times for rides were posted incorrectly. E.g. 15 mins for The Mummy when we queued for over an hour. Other issues encountered include Staff allowing groups of tourists to join the single rider queues when it was very clear they were all together and just attempting to queue jump, 3D glasses for transformers ran out so had to wait for staff to replace. no one stopping use of phones, queue management was awful. Filling up rows 1 person at a time instead of 4. The park is very small compared to other theme parks so there is no excuse for the multitude of errors we saw when visiting. In fact this should be the best operated Universal Location due to the size but it's by far the worst we've been to. Would I return here? Absolutely not. I would recommend it though for a single visit as long as you know what to expect. hopefully reviews like this will enable others to have a better trip",

What we got was a total of hours of waiting in confusing rooms at the individual attractions and ultimately a cancellation on our part because we simply couldn't stand anymore. You're not a young 30-year-old who can stand the endless waiting and standing. At Transformers, at Battlestar Galaktika and in the Temple of the Mummy we queued for well over 3 hours and ultimately saw nothing!!! With such a hefty entrance fee, this was the most expensive wait and the biggest disappointment we have ever experienced. What I found particularly bad was that there was no indication of waiting times in the morning hours. Only when we left the studios in the afternoon, deeply disappointed and pissed off, did we see waiting times (45-80 minutes). I also have to mention that you can and probably should buy express entry (extra entry with shortened waiting times) for 100 SGD per person if you want to experience anything at all in this park and dont want to spend almost the entire time of your stay waiting. Two people 246 SGD for Cable Car and Universal Studios entrance 200 SGD Express 446 SGD Too Much!!!",

                "review_text": "Hello to every who's gonna read my review. i will share a very brief details on my experience i had during the public holiday. Of course compare to where I came from, the rides at USS were exceptional, amazing and wonderful. I especially love the ride \"Revenge of Mummy\" and the huge rollercoaster \"Battlestar Galactica: Human\". It was extremely enjoyable that my siblings and I could not stop moving trying to queue up on our next rides. Something to be aware of: 1. For muslims, the food outlets inside the theme park mostly consist with the selling of beers and non-halal food/drinks but there's one halal stall at the Far Far Away Land area called the \"Goldilocks (something)\" so.. for foreigners, you might as well have breakfast at home and bring some snacks along with you. 2. Be aware that the queue is a no joke thing, it can be extremely long especially \"Revenge of Mummy\", \"Battlestar Galactica: Cylon\", \"Puss In Boots' Giant Journey\" and all of the Jurrasic Park rides. To be frank, the queue might take up to 1-2 hours especially during peak time 11-2pm. So it's a matter of you willing to wait or not. 3. Be aware of people (especially foreigners who's Indians). Sadly, from my experience, they tried to cheat on us and cut our queue to access the ride faster and be ahead of us Not only that, they pushed one of my family members during the queue multiple times to the point we have to speak up. Totally not a pleasant experience. 4. You can access the link of USS by scanning the bar code posted right before going into USS as this will provide you with a map of the theme park, the rides available on that day and its estimated waiting time. 5. Lastly, my other main reason as to why I had to rate USS 3-4/5 was because of some rude behaviours of the workers. Yes it's understandable that you have been working a whole day taking care of the rides under the hot sun and dealing with customers/visitors but that does not justify the rudeness and incompetency that you had show towards these people who not only bought tickets to have a good time playing rides in the theme park but also are the ones who enabled you to have the paycheck you're receiving. For the Sesame Street Ride lady waiting in front of the door, I am here to write to you on how rude you were and that your statement, tone and how you shouted at customers are totally NOT professional and a disgusting behaviour. If you cannot cope with working there to the point you had to push and shout at customers just because the rides were closed then you should have just resign. In other words lady in blue shirt with glasses working at Sesame Street ride at 7.55pm on 10th February 2024, you could have provide us visitors with better approach instead of what you've done, not only that it had also caused us to have a tainted image of this \"good and friendly neighbourhood of Singapore\", it had also stained our excitement by the end of the day at USS. Suggestions: 1. Better maintanence on the rides as by the end of the day some rides closed down due to maintanence and it take quite long compared to during lunch time (about 5mins). 2. More Halal food stalls for the muslim, easy access to Prayer rooms and please clean the toilet, it's quite stinky, dirty and the rubbish was too full that it falls out to the floor. 3. Improvements of customer service (eg. don't be rude and be friendly) 4. To reduce waiting time, every available seats per ride should be completely filled. I think that's all, thank you for reading and hope you get some knowledge and enjoyed it!",

I had to wait for almost an hour for the rides I could ride, but the weather helped and it was cloudy most of the time, so I made it through. If the sun was hot, it would have been difficult to endure. Although the overall scale is smaller than Universal Studios Japan, the rides were much more fun and scary than those in Japan. Personally, I think Japan competes with screens that feature flashy characters and rides that aren't scary. In Singapore, the fear was much greater as I didn't know what would come out of the darkness. I finally got a seat after waiting for the restaurant. It was next to the waffle shop past Jurassic Park, and the chicken was bigger than the original one, so I couldn't eat it all. The food was salty. They only gave me a cup because the drinks had unlimited refills. I wasn't able to see the water show because the timing wasn't right, but as I was passing by the entrance to the water show, I saw a show (?) where a baby dinosaur hatches from an egg, and it was quite realistic and fun. I couldn't ride much even after walking over 20,000 steps due to a failure in the game of wits, but next time I go, I'm going to try riding some equipment I haven't been able to ride.",

By midday the wait times for most adult rides are 60 mins. Was annoyed to see rides taking off with half full carriages just because ride operators didnt want to force or allocate singles to go with groups of 3 etc. just blows out the wait times for everyone. Pack your own food and drink! Our ticket included a 20 meal voucher each - it didnt go far and the food was average. Toilets were very clean, park was clean, gardens well maintained. All in all was a good day but we left after the water show that started at 1.30 as we didnt want to wait an hour to go on a ride.",

Only irritating part was waiting time which went Upto 100 mins and there is no place to sit anywhere. You can take the busy rides during the afternoon when many people will go for lunch. One of the best show was water world and be ready to get drenched . We felt soft toys are less costlier when l compared to outside place. Do wear good shoes and there is no place to change the dress . There is dry zone place where we need to pay. We can meet and greet the cartoon / animation characters in where there is specific timings. We can take photo with them . Do install uss app where we can see the waiting time and route . There is free wifi and my suggestion was they could have given hard copy of map.",

Tickets should be booked in advance. In the rides the maximum waiting time on a weekend was 25-30 minutes even though they say 40 minutes. Many shops were there for buying candies, Starbucks, Souvenir store which were very overpriced just because Universal Studio was written in them. The souvenir shop will lead you to the road of poverty. The staff was friendly. You will need to spend at least 7-8 hours to explore it fully. Some restaurants are also there inside including an Indian restaurant. The palace in the beginning is good for taking pictures. Also the mummy ride was very good. All rides were open except the Water World Show. Overall a good experience for all ages.",

When I first came here I didn't buy the express pass, this caused me to wait in line for roughly 1 hours in line for the Galactic Cyclone ride. It was unbearable for waiting so long, and I also went to queue in the mummy ride for nearly 45 minutes just for a minute ride. Anyway, I got the express pass about 1pm and I have a great experience afterwards, like shorten queue and faster access. This is a very family friendly place where it's okay to let families member wait in the family room in each ride in case the family members aren't fit for the ride.",

Bying from online can save time from long queue on the spot. To avoid queue at entry and rides additional Universal Express pass can be purchased. Usually there is long queue in the morning at opening. But with time rush is less than usual. The park is divided in diffrent zone according to diffrent movie theme. This place is very attractive, rides are fantastic but some are restricted for child. Lots of fun and shows are there. One can download Universal Studio Singapore app on mobile and can have live update of the shows while in the park. It will take around 4 to 6 hours depending on how many rides you are enjoing, crowd and your schedule. Foods and drink are quite expensive there. Don't forget to bring cap, sunglass, umbrella.

The long que at transformers ride was around 90minutes and u don't realise it at all until mid way. There is no staff around to guide u for emergency. Its Absolutely unorganized 2. There is no or less seating across the area or even for attractions with long distance making it worst and painful 3. Most of the staff are rude with you esp if you belong to different community or are a tourist and not a localite. They shout at u for no reason. 4. The parade is only done on Sundays and most characters are not available on weekdays. We met the puss cat who was equally rude with us in behavior. Why even act like a character if u cnt handle your role humbly? 5. After the entire days hectic walk when we left, the train que was again huge, trains run v v slow with bad cooling and suffocates you as it's so packed. Taxi stop is v far so making it difficult. As usual no place to sit so u have to kill yourself. 6. It was so tiring that my 5yrs old slept and we had to carry her in our arms waiting in this exit que to get the express train. The escalators to climb up to board the train were not functional so we had to take huge staircase with her and our bags with other child. There was no priority given to us despite having a child in arms. All in all, worst experience for huge amount with no facilities to make you comfortable as a guest. They only need your money to make business but give a damn to you or your comfort.",

Feels like weve wasted a precious day from our trip to Singapore on being hot tired sweaty frustrated and hugely out of pocket. Even though we went early and on a Monday there were such long lines, far longer than the stated time, the ride operators were so slow at each round of the ride they fill it up with like 70% of the people with fast track tickets so felt really unfair. The fast track ticket was nearly as expensive as the main ticket and you have to buy it at the same time as the main ticket. We had a one year old baby and it was very frustrating to just have to carry him in a 40 minute plus queue, we ended up leaving most queues. Even the free shows, you have to get to them in advance otherwise you just miss them and have to wait another two hours for the next show. The meet and greet was so boring, unlike other theme parks where you can interact with the characters, here they just stand behind a rope and people queue up in the heat to take a quick photo and leave. The food again was also majorly disappointing, the cheapest thing you could get was water for 4 and soda for 5 everything else is double restaurant price too and not many great options, mainly just junk food and only 3 are halal. On a positive note the decor in the park was really nice but unfortunately just nothing interactive that you can enjoy without having to queue up for. At the very least they should make all queuing areas air conditioned and properly shaded, not just some far away fans and plastic canopy. There arent even benches to just sit outside to have a rest people just sit in the pavement or have to sit in a restaurant and pay for food. Just overall really not worth the price, came home so deflated unfortunately and wanting a refund as we did not enjoy it. I wouldnt recommend or return - particularly to people with young families.",

Although the standard about the same, which means good job for maintaining it. But I certainly hope USS can be more innovative and improve the facilities instead.

(Tips) Recommended to enter as early as possible so that you can enjoy all the rides as some rides queue time might vary, 5min to average 30min, or sometimes to 120min per ride. Express addon is more than double than normal ticket, but if you want to fully enjoy all rides, consider it. Locker is free to use (with certain quota limit like first 40min is free) and available everywhere. Bring tumbler or water bottle as you can refill it at almost all restrooms area where there's drinking water machine. Food is slightly more expensive, given it's tourist spot, but quality is there. Fair. Download apps, check the special showtime and plan your tour so that you can catch the best show. Bring light raincoat if you want to play water games and avoid purchase expensive raincoat on the spot. Staffs most of them are friendly and helpful. Just remember to smile and ask them nicely. They been repeatedly doing the same thing over and over might get bored sometimes.",

Because I didn't buy the ticket from the official website, I couldn't enter after 9 o'clock, so I just leisurely entered around 11 o'clock. Transformer upon entering (the app says to wait for 40 minutes, but the wait is for about an hour) Cyclone (30 minutes waiting on the app, 30 minutes actually waiting - it goes away faster than you think) *Really scary. The speed is no joke, but every moment is fast from the start... My feet are floating. It keeps spinning. I almost went crazy. When I come down, my legs are shaking and I feel dizzy. Human (wait for 30 minutes on the app, actually wait for about 20 minutes - it goes away quickly like a cyclone) *I was relieved because there was a footrest, but somehow... when I sit on the chair, my body sinks in and my feet float. Unless you are an adult male over 170cm tall, you cannot touch it. Fortunately, it is slower than a cyclone. Still, I just ran from the starting section up. I almost went crazy with this too. Mummy (Originally, it is a ride with a crazy wait, but it is occasionally closed for maintenance reasons and reopens. If you aim for that time, there is a 5-minute wait, but when you actually get on the human, you start re-entering and get in quickly. But as people come out to get on the ride, the wait becomes 80 minutes) * The interior is cool! Shaking a lot.. Shaking back and forth and left and right. Jurassic (30 minutes on the app - about 20 minutes in reality? It goes away quickly. Unless there is an accident in front) *Every boat is different, but if it doesn't get wet, it doesn't get wet, and if it gets wet, everything gets wet. Depends on who is on the boat with you. For your information, everyone on the boat I was on got very wet. Fortunately, the sunlight is strong so it dries quickly. When you come out of Jurassic, there is a clothes drying tub for a fee. It's smaller than the US or Japan, so it's possible to take the representative train without express. If I buy Express, I can ride it multiple times? The food was pretty good too. If you go to the Jurassic food court, there is a lot of food.",

                "review_text": "We went there and bought the general admission ticket for 8085 per person. Then, when we went inside, it was overcrowded. When we went for a ride, it was a 100-minute waityes, over 1 hour just for 1 ride out of 16 attractions. So, to overcome this, the park offers you an express ticket for 100 per person. The ticket counter will sell you a ticket, but most of the attractions are not suitable for kids under 122 cm. So it was a waste of money for us. Altogether, we spent 600 plus 100 for the cable car. By spending 100 on express tickets you will feel like VIP (Very Important Person) as normal crowd is waiting for hours an hours while you can come in and out very quickly. I should have left my feeling at home in Australia that everyone is equal as the park doesn't treat you like that. My question is when they can accommodate large express ticket crowd why not others or make 1 price ticket and only let limited crowd in and out like in Night Safari where you have to pre book. Or else increase the staff or attractions facility. Surely if the business is making money then investing in impoverment won't be a issue. It lacks simple management solutions even though it Universal Studios. The park is overcrowded with Indians tourist mainly. Please mind I am an Indian Australian too. Not against any race, but the park staff was not able to control the crowd. My family and I were pushed 3-4 times while waiting for the attractions. I was elbowed twice. My wife and kid was pushed back by a man so he could break the queue and come to the front of the queue. Also, by the way, most of the time, no one was following the queue. The park will keep selling tickets to make more money; it's like quantity but not quality. I would not recommend it to families with young children or infants and toddlers as it's a waste of time and money. It will probably be okay with children over 6 -7 years plus, not for 3-4 years or below. If you have never being to Universal Studios then go for it. After the experience from Universal Studios we decided to cancel all other plan to water world and rest of the sentosa as I rather have relax holiday in the hotel pool relax and enjoy with kids rather then get pushed around, elbowed or rush around. Probably I would choose Thailand as it got everything to offer to everyone and the management on venue's is way better.",

Afterwards i went to Battlestar Galactica. i was already waiting my turn at the gate but everyone was suddenly asked to return to the queue. As all of us were waiting, there wasnt any information or explanation given. We waited for a good 10-15 mins before an announcement was made that there were technical difficulties and the rides are delayed. Waited for 10 mins and no updates were given how long. Slowly everyone started leaving. A man asked the staff what is happening and the staff only said we have technical difficulties and unfortunately we dont exactly know what is causing it. You can stay but we dont know how long it will take or you can leave. I waited for about 15 mins and they still said they did not know what the issue was. There wont be much they would do for service recovery either. So i feel like the early entry ticket was wasted or useless as i didnt get to ride at all afterwards. The ride was only working about 30 mins after i left which is about the same time that more crowds were forming. When i wanted to ride, the wait time was more than 2 hours. Not only did i not get to ride it, when i waited for the transformer photo taking, it also delayed for 10-15 mins. Now i understand as it might be difficult to wear the costume but it was kinda frustrating as the queue was under the hot sun. We were not allowed to wait under the shelter either as it is considered to be entering the staffs zone. USS used to be fun and enjoyable, now just seems to be full of delays and issues without any service recovery. If you were to complain, they wont do anything much either and probably wont do anything when i write this review too. So just take note of this if you plan on going USS.",

The rides were fantastic, with my favorites being the Transformers ride, Battlestar Galactica, and The Mummy. These rides were thrilling and well worth the visit. However, I encountered a significant issue with the line management. There were often no staff present to guide the lines or monitor the crowd, which led to many people cutting in line. A specific group (and race) was particularly disrespectful, blatantly cutting lines and even applauding themselves for doing so. They were in large groups, which made the situation even more frustrating and disrupted the overall experience. Additionally, in such a closed environment, the lack of proper ventilation became quite apparent, making it uncomfortable with the poor smell lingering around. Sadly, the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure was closed during my visit, which was disappointing as I was looking forward to it. Despite these issues, I would still recommend visiting Universal Studios Singapore. The rides and attractions are top-notch, but I would advise against going on weekends to avoid the large crowds. Also, be vigilant for line cutters to ensure a more enjoyable experience.",

According to the queue time for Battlestar Galactica, it will be a 2hrs wait, after waiting in line with an express pass of 30 minutes, it was closed due to wet weather. We went on other rides. I think age has caught up with me and I found Mummy ride to be scary also, especially when I went backwards. Food at the Discovery Food Centre was expensive, with an average of 16/main. Nonetheless, it was pretty expected and fortunately, there was a discount for Passion Card members. For WaterWorld, the staff really take pails and pails of water and one will be drenched if you are seated in the splash zone. Do sit in the area if you are alright getting wet. Fortunately, there are drying pods outside the area.",

They have to constantly stop the ride because the attendants havent queued enough people, the attendants just chitchat with one another while the ride is stopped waiting for riders, they take 75% from the express pass line sometimes 100% from the express pass line while letting cars stop and go unfilled. Its ludicrous. The ticket portal does not work for foreign credit cards and theres no way to buy with Apple/Google Pay. This was a problem 1yr ago and its still there. You have to shop 3rd party vendors for advanced ticket purchase but still have to wait in a long queue at customer service to get your park ticket. Thats bonkers. The app didnt work for half the day.

The operators take their time to evacuate the attraction but especially to install it. The wagons are not even filled and instructions are recalled at the start of each turn even though we have heard them 150 times before. Longer transition times than attraction times... - very time-consuming mandatory locker system (waiting at terminals, touch screen bug). Why not use the same system as the other parks? - the density of people is much too high. They have to determine maximum quotas, the park is small. In short, an amateur category compared to Disneyland Paris, Europapark or even Universal Los Angeles",

And there was a bit of queue to enter the park too. Was very disappointed that the first ride we went to, had a malfunction. And we had spent 40mins waiting to go for the ride. Only to have it stop just as it had started. There were instructions to stay in our seats and that the ride would resume soon. We waited for another 20mins. We had thought the ride would resume. But we were brought to the end of the ride. After spending more than an hour in the the attraction. The staff there gave the affected guests a free fast pass for one ride. But still, time had been wasted. But most of the day, we just spent waiting to get on rides as the timing would be 30 to 60mins for each ride. I guess because the park was blocked and they were making another attraction. But it was also super crowded! And not only that, but it was also hard to get around. And while queing up, some guests kept pushing and going into our space. Overall not a good experience today. But the rides were great as usual. Maybe next time, there could be a limit as to how much guests should be allowed into the park. As it really was too crowded. Thank you",

There were long queue for almost all the rides and we didn't get to enjoy much although I had a full day on one of my visits. The theming are good, some rides are enjoyable, but I don't think it's worth the money.

Every game requires you to wait in line for 45-90 minutes, so if you try hard all day, you can play 3 games (and you'll be tired from having to queue a lot). While you have to wait in line for your turn, people who buy additional priority cards (Universal Express) take turns passing you to play first, turning you into a 2nd class citizen in this area! Besides the roller coaster game called Cyclone which is unique, the other games are also normal, especially the 4D cinema (in the Far Far Away area) is very ordinary. Outdoor shows like Minion and Mega are boring as hell (and last about 5-10 minutes). There is not much shade in the park, and especially there is almost no place to sit and rest, so walking all afternoon in the sun in this area is a torture. In short, if you want to play games comfortably here, in addition to the entrance ticket (83 SGD), you must also buy a priority card (120 SGD). Otherwise, just come here to walk and take pictures.",

I thought whether to buy express ticket, on the day we visited, even it was LNY peak period, riding attractions was enough to enjoy without the express ticket. ** revisited in July, and it was crowded and queue were still long until the late evening. So we used single rider to avoid longer waiting time for our 2nd round of ride. My sons loved there so much. Not that big we could look around within a day, which is good thing for us. For attractions, Transformer 4D, mummy, shrek 4D were great. Strongly recommend Water world show- they are perform twice a day at 1:30pm and 4:30pm. Human, cylon, and the water ride in Jurassic park were good for me but seems some people dislike these ones due to the height or getting wet. The Water ride is definitely wet. Youd better preparing raincoat seriously. treasure hunter, troll show, puss in boots were just okay for us. There was lots of photo spot and characters so check the time first. Dragon and kungfu panda is at 7:30pm. For lunch, we had hotdog in jurassic park. Almost 20 per person.",

While the overall experience was exhilarating, there were a couple of issues that prevented me from giving it a perfect 5-star rating. **What I Loved:** 1. **Rides and Attractions:** The rides are top-notch, especially Battlestar Galactica and Revenge of the Mummy. The attention to detail in each themed area is commendable. 2. **Immersive Worlds:** Walking through Hollywood, Ancient Egypt, and Far Far Away felt like stepping into beloved movies. The ambiance is captivating. 3. **Shows and Performances:** The WaterWorld show and the street performances added an extra layer of entertainment. Kudos to the talented performers! **Areas for Improvement:** 1. **Queue Times:** You hit the nail on the head here. The queue times displayed often didn't match the actual wait. Waiting for 20 minutes turned into a 2-hour ordeal. 2. **Seating:** Agreed! Some queue lines lacked seating areas. Standing for hours can be exhausting, especially in the tropical heat. **Tips for Fellow Visitors:** - **Early Bird Advantage:** Arrive early to beat the crowds and enjoy shorter wait times. - **Hydrate and Rest:** Bring water and take short breaks. Your feet will thank you! - **Patience Is Key:** Remember, everyone's there for the same reasonto have a blast! Despite the glitches, Universal Studios Singapore remains a must-visit for thrill-seekers and movie buffs alike. Just be prepared for a few twists and turns beyond the rides!",

We waited for more than 30 minutes per ride on average, with one ride (Jurassic Park) that exceeded an hour of wait. The roller coasters were 40 mins more on average, it was truly a horrible experience. In the shrek theater, one woman yelled at all of us for trying to enter when she opened the door with no clear instructions with what we should do. One person who was in charge of the bumblebee ride (turning cups) was incredibly rude to an Indian woman as he wrongly miscalculated the number of tickets that was given to him. The overall experience was terrible and avoid this amusement park at all costs. If it wasnt for the google system, Id give this place a -100 stars for being overcrowded, bad service attitude, and horrible ride experiences. This park is not worth visiting and should reflect on their operation and service. They should also consider making the fast pass actually fast as opposed to us throwing worthless money into a pass that made us wait for 60 mins with the worst service possible.",

Those are amazing and unique. Rest and below average. Now cons: 1. There is long queue on all rides, you can expect average 90 mins and upto 2.5 hours in each ride. Practically its impossible to cover all rides on standard pass. I think it management should limit admissions in a day so that queue can be reduced. Right now its totally not worth it just because of queue. With 2 hours of waiting you will cover only 4 rides. Each ride will last for 5-10 mins and you will be in queue for 8 hours. This not at all good. 2. If you are looking for trilling rides and experience, this might not be right place gor you as they have very limited trilling rides, only 4. And waiting time on rides make it worst. Conclusion: Because of queue, its not value for money if you purchase standard pass. If you purchase express pass, its still not value for money because of high ticket cost and less number of attractions. However if you do not mind paying for express pass, go ahead and try once. Its good.",

First off they are militant about not having your phone or any bag on you and check prior to entering the queue meaning you can't even try and plan your day whilst waiting. And also basically no ride set up and amusement when waiting in line makes for a rather long and boring wait. Even the 1st class citizens who pay more than the price of the park ticket again to get the 'priority pass' had to wait about 30 minutes for the ride. Absolutely detest this scummy system parks seem to use but it seems to be standard and not normally too much of an issue if regular queue times are reasonable and rides have single rides options (of which I only seen this option for the transformer 4d coaster at Singapore universal) Eventually we managed to get on the coaster and it was pretty mid, the hulk or velocicoaster from Florida this is not. Anyway this set the scene for the rest of the day. Huge lines for pretty much all rides / shows and pretty average when you actually got to experience it. Also this was a Monday so I don't know if that makes a difference but I wouldn't want to see this park on a busy weekend. The water world show was ok. Probably the best thing there... And actually managed to see it without a massive wait which was a bonus. Overall I would avoid this park, it would make for an ok day out if they let about half of the people in on a daily basis but that would not line their coffers I guess....",

                "review_text": "The attraction was great, but I had a very unpleasant experience waiting outside for \"Meet the Transformers\" with my Transformer child. We were waiting outside the established control line when an employee asked us to move in a different direction, so we moved to the location she requested. An employee wearing a nametag named Hafiz came back angrily and asked me to go somewhere else. I didn't think it was my fault because I followed the location requested by the staff when I initially requested a move. And since I followed the staff's instructions and stayed outside the clearly established control line, if my location was an issue, the control line was wrong or it was the staff's fault who asked me to move first, not mine. So, if necessary, I think it is something to kindly explain and provide guidance to, and not something to get angry at and throw a tantrum at my 8-year-old child and me. I hope your company reflects on whether holding an event that makes visitors angry is in line with your vision and mission statement. Thanks to Hafiz, my child and I were in a very good mood after coming here to freshen up. Thank you for giving me the worst experience(?)",

We purposely went on a weekday as weekends are very crowded. I was surprised to see the kind of rush here. The entry time for normal ticket was 10AM but I myself entered around 9.45AM as the gates were open. It was mind boggling to see that they have just provided tickets without any sense of whats happening inside. Sadly, the wait time for every ride for a Normal Ticket was 120 mins, even the people who had taken VIP tickets which has line free access to swings were waiting 35-45 mins for their turn. It was a low-key experience to see such kind of management at a place like this. Overall my experience was pretty bad just because of the Ticket price & kind of wait time they had given for every ride that just lasted fraction of seconds. They should really improve the management to understand headcount vs wait time/ride.",

                "review_text": "Universal Studios Singapore is one of the top attractions on Sentosa Island, offering a fun-filled day of thrilling rides, entertaining shows, and a dose of Hollywood magic. I visited Universal Studios in September, and while the experience was enjoyable overall, there were a few downsides that made the day less smooth than expected. The first thing to note is that it was *extremely hot* when we visited. Singapores tropical climate is hot and humid year-round, and being out in the sun all day can take a toll. I would highly recommend bringing a hat, plenty of sunscreen, and staying hydrated, as there is limited shade in some areas of the park. Despite the heat, the excitement of the park and the energy of the visitors kept the mood upbeat. One of the biggest drawbacks of our visit was the *long queues*. Universal Studios Singapore is a very popular destination, especially on weekends and holidays, which means waiting times for rides can easily exceed 45 minutes to an hour. The popular attractions like *Transformers: The Ride* and *Revenge of the Mummy* had some of the longest lines, and waiting under the sun only added to the discomfort. If youre not a fan of waiting or dont want to spend the majority of your day standing in line, I highly recommend upgrading to a *VIP pass or Express membership*. These passes allow you to skip the regular queues, saving you a lot of time and ensuring you can experience more rides without the frustration of long waits. Its definitely a splurge, but I found it to be worth it if you want to maximize your time and avoid the heat. As for the rides themselves, Universal Studios offers a variety of experiences, but if youre a thrill-seeker, you may find some of them underwhelming compared to other parks like *Ferrari World* in Abu Dhabi. For example, while the *Battlestar Galactica* roller coasters are exciting, they don't compare to the intense thrills of Ferrari Worlds *Formula Rossa*the fastest roller coaster in the world. Universal Studios rides are more family-friendly and are designed to cater to all age groups, which means the thrill level is a bit toned down compared to parks focused on extreme rides. That said, there are still a few standout attractions that are well worth trying. *Transformers: The Ride* is an amazing 3D experience that fully immerses you in the world of the Autobots and Decepticons. The visual effects and motion simulation are incredibly well done, and it was one of the highlights of my visit. *Revenge of the Mummy* is another great ride, blending dark indoor roller coaster elements with special effects and surprises. These rides offer unique experiences that you won't find in many other parks, making them worth the wait, even if the queues are long. In addition to the rides, Universal Studios Singapore offers plenty of entertainment with live shows and character meet-and-greets. However, the shows also tend to attract large crowds, so it's best to plan your day carefully to catch them without missing out on too many rides. **Conclusion:** Universal Studios Singapore is a fun park with a good mix of rides, shows, and Hollywood-themed attractions, but there are a few things to keep in mind before visiting. The heat can be intense, so come prepared, and the long queues can be frustrating. If you want to make the most of your day, I highly recommend opting for a VIP pass or Express membership to skip the lines. While the rides here are more family-friendly and not as intense as those in Ferrari World, they still offer a unique and enjoyable experience. Just be ready for a full day of fun, excitement, and a little bit of waiting.",

From what we experienced, i highly recommend going there between Mon-Thursday. Friday-Sunday is extremely busy which greatly affects wait time. 1. Visit the place after lunch. This is once place where the early bird failed to catch the worm. If you visit as soon as the park opens you will be competing with other customers waiting in line. 2. It is best to visit after lunch where most of the que is drastically lower and we still manage to enjoy all the rides. Disclaimer: this might work during weekdays. It might be busier during the weekend. 3. download the USS app so you have an idea the current wait time on each ride and plan which rid to take first. 4. Don't bring your kids to the Steven Spielberger (lights, camera, action) ride. In fact don't go here specially during long ques. There's nothing interesting in this ride really unless you're into movie special effects. That said, the effect shown in the ride is not even half of what is actually done on actual movies. 5.Give the gift shop a chance. You might find cheap souvenirs there. I bought my Toothless cap for 10 SGD and the ears move! 6. keep an eye on billboards with schedules written on them. You might find interesting surprise event like meeting Blue the raptor from Jurassic park. Word of caution though he might take a nibble. Last but not the least enjoy your time in USS!",

The cleanliness of the park deserves special mention, as it significantly enhances the experience for visitors of all ages.

However, the waiting times for attractions are generally acceptable, though peak times can see longer waits, which is typical for a popular theme park. One area for improvement would be the addition of more resting areas, particularly for the elderly and young children. Incorporating more shaded or indoor rest spots could make the park even more accommodating for all age groups, reinforcing its status as a family-friendly destination.",

That might have even been the reason the queues were so long, cause people with a fast track pass kept being let through. It's very pay to win. However the park is pretty but very small. Not a lot of rides (but therefore an awful lot of people, even on a weekday). For us this was the most overpriced and most easy to skip experience when visiting singapore and probably the amusement park we enjoyed the least so far.

Once the Minion area opens, I guess guestflows will be better. It rubbed me the wrong way that they heavily advertise their Express pass service. Every 100 or so meters there was an employee waiving around with a banner about this. The River Adventure ride was closed for maintenance, which wasn't advertised during booking, on the app or on the website. A huge let down, because the amount of big rides is already quite limited. We arrived at 10 sharp and managed to complete the big 7 rides by 11. When we walked back towards the entrance the queues really started to built up there. So; arrive early. Start at Transformers, then work your way towards the Shrek area. At certain times the music/entertainment was blasting out very loudly. In combination with the high amount of guests, sometimea very narrow paths that were obstructes by themeing, this created a rather unpleasant and chaotic environment. 60 Eur admission seemed fair to us. We will not be going back anytime soon. If they added a few more areas, we would consider it.",

                "review_text": "Having visited Universal Studios Singapore several times before, I recently returned after a long hiatus, eager to see how it had evolved. Unfortunately, my recent experience wasn't ideal. Despite purchasing tickets weeks in advance, the park was extremely crowded. While I expected lines for the rides, the wait times were excessive. We queued for the Cyclone roller coaster for over two and a half hours, only to be met with an announcement of an indefinite delay. This, coupled with the intense heat, led us to abandon the queue, a decision shared by many others. We did manage to experience two other rides, but each came with a wait time of at least an hour. The congestion was pervasive, impacting even the express lines. It felt as though the park had overreached its capacity, diminishing the overall experience. Perhaps implementing a queuing limit or a reservation system for popular rides would alleviate this issue. Compared to other Universal Studios parks, such as those in Japan or Orlando, Singapore's offering feels smaller and less engaging. While it may be a suitable option for those with budget constraints or limited travel opportunities, especially within Southeast Asia, I would recommend exploring other Universal Studios parks for a more fulfilling experience. It's worth noting that I visited during peak season (Indonesia's holiday, causing influx of visits in Singapore) which undoubtedly contributed to the extensive wait times. A friend who visited recently during the off-season reported significantly shorter queues. While longer waits are expected during peak periods, the park should consider implementing measures to improve the queuing system and overall guest experience during these busy times.",

Transformers, the Mummy, Jurassic park, Shrek 4D cinema were worth the wait. The rides whilst thrilling were too short especially considering the que times. Food as expected was overpriced. Tip 1 : get your souvenirs at the main shop near the entrance as they have the full range so you can enjoy them throughout your visit. Tip 2 : be aware that the park may close early on some days. Tip 3 : your day will suck as outdoor rides will not operate if it rains heavily. Tip 4 : Ask the operator if the ride shakes you about to check suitability for those who may not like it.

Unfortunately, I booked our tickets through a sponsored link on Headout, unaware of the complexities involved. The ticketing process was confusing; in the past, there used to be one entrance ticket for the whole day entry, but now there are separate day and night passes. Misled by Headout's website, we unknowingly purchased day passes instead of night passes, spending 366 with express passes included for 2 persons only. When we arrived at the entrance, we hoped the staff would be understanding and allow us to switch to night passes with a willingness to pay the difference. However, we were denied entry with no flexibility shown. It felt unnecessarily harsh, especially since we had already paid for entry and the company had profited from it. The refusal to accommodate or show empathy was deeply disappointing. We were told to buy new tickets if we wanted to enterwe were reluctant to spend a total of 600-800 for just a few hours at a small and overcrowded theme park. In the end, we left and spent the money at VivoCity on some nice shoes instead. This experience taught us a hard lesson, spending 366 to return home upon arrival was really an upsetting experience and we doubt we will be returning to USS anytime soon.",

I bought an express pass, however a lot of the rides did not have Universal Express lanes so I ended up queuing even though I spent RM313 on the express pass which is double of the admission ticket. Disappointing. The Madagascar & Egypt attractions were closed, very disappointing. Battlestar Galactica was a walk in a park, not even slightly exciting. Disappointing. The toilets did not have any bidet, only tissue paper. First world country? Weird, even a third world country has a bidet.

The rides here are definitely really tame and not what I would go for if I were looking for any actual thrill rollercoaster wise - though their indoor rides like the Mummy are good. Be prepared if you want to sit on the jurassic ride as you will almost certainly get wet - socks, shoes, etc. Nearly all the staff were visibly dry and unwelcoming to the point we noticed and discussed it. Very aloof, easily annoyed etc. Staff on waterworld on the other hand were really interactive and brilliant choices for their roles. I was unsure about watching a live show but it was incredibly gripping and engaging. Definitely recommend to plan your visit around the show timings if you're going.",

Please don't bring young kids onto rollercoaster rides like transformers or mummy they keep crying summore its a literal drop rollercoaster. I recommend kt grill and goldilocks for food. Some ride need to pay for locker, pls use locker or else mafan need to put belongings somewhere when on a ride. 1. Revenge of the mummy. The queues are long. My entire family was flabbergasted and almost vomited. Vigorous spinning, dropping and speeding up. Do not recommend for young kids and weak people, older kids maybe can lah based on if they are ok with it 2. Transformers 4d movie. It was also rollercoaster with spinning and speeding up, its kinda nice but queue is long 3. Seasame street spaghetti space chase. Great for seniors and younger children but no thrill at all it's so slow 4. Raptor rapids. My favourite ride so far. Guy at entrance was funny. The ride itself was exciting and there was a drop at the end. Others clothes were all soaked but only my converse was drenched. I thought the trex would spray water at us 5. Trolls hug time jubilee. Relaxing and fun for young families with bubbles and confetti. 6. Waterworld show. It was quite funny and exciting but not rlly for young kids becoz got gunfire, fireworks, fire and explosions. Don't sit at blue seats because you WILL get wet. The show itself 20 minutes long.",

Also, avoid visiting the park during peak period, eg the school holidays and festive seasons. It is so overcrowded that it would take you almost a full day (or about 8 hours) just to enjoy 4 (or if you are lucky, 5) rides, with each ride lasting for less than 5 mins on average. Because most of the time would be spent on queuing and waiting for these rides. The same applies to dining at USS and taking the Sentosa Express. Yet, there are not enough seats or benches to rest tired feet. You would either be standing most of the time, or sitting on the sidewalks. Moreoever, there's little crowd control. It's crazy! To be honest, this park does not have the capacity to handle huge crowds. Yet, it tends to bite off more than it can chew.

Rides were pretty good. I was glad I had the express pass so skipped lines where I could. It was a pretty quiet day thankfully for everyone in the park. Lines overall weren't that long. But I was still glad to have paid the extra money. For those who don't pay the extra money on a busy day, that would be unbearable. You would be standing in line all day. Very annoying that there are some rides that you can't slip the line on too. Also unfortunate that minion world was still be worked on, so couldnt visit that large part of the park. It really impacts the flow of the park. Overall, we enjoyed our day, but it cost a fortune, and the food prices (particularly the hot dog and coke deal) are beyond a joke.",

Price increased double (express pass is now 140 onsite per pax) compared to previously where one has the option to decide on day itself if opt for it. And again, the monopolizing impact of USS in each city. We did the VIP experience today for birthday gal and few friends, they were all thrilled and enjoyed to fullest under the best care of VIP team guide Shah, who was so patient and entertaining to kids! In the end the kids stayed till almost to closing and wanted to go on for more. Thank you Shah for a most memorable bday at USS! Crowds were at high this week, but so glad the VIP lanyard gave the kids priority in almost every ride and food queue. Wanted to hold the party in Enchanted Castle function room, but it was pretty outdated in decor. We are at good ease to choose this in the end for a quality celebration. Only bummed is for more new and bigger restaurants in USS to serve full capacity visitors. About time to start revamp and enhancements to match with post covid times. Pre covid was great with many rides to go for, esp for kids. For past 2 years, quite a number of rides and street performances are affected but USS still manages to keep all spirits hyped by constantly having new events and activities with measures in place. Bummer for the restos and cafes and kiosks as many are shut. Would have to give thumbs up to Megatron who never failed to amuse audience for each and every session. Its as if he was real talking to audience with lots of spontaniety and humor. Always happy to see the mascots on streets even though no contact.",

From thrilling rides to immersive attractions, its a must-visit spot for anyone traveling to Sentosa Island. The park is well-organized, and the themed zoneslike Ancient Egypt, Jurassic World, and Hollywood Boulevardtransport you into different worlds with their detailed designs and exciting attractions. Some of the standout rides include Battlestar Galactica, a high-adrenaline roller coaster, and Transformers: The Ride, which offers an incredible 4D experience. Families will enjoy the interactive shows and gentler rides, ensuring theres something for everyone. However, during my visit, I was disappointed to find that the Minion Land attraction was temporarily closed for maintenance. While this was unfortunate, the rest of the park had so much to offer that it didnt take away from the overall experience. Id recommend checking the official website for updates before planning your visit. The park staff were friendly and efficient, and the food and beverage options were diverse, catering to all tastes. Pro tip: purchasing an express pass is worth it to skip the long queues during peak hours. Universal Studios Singapore is a thrilling escape that guarantees unforgettable memories, even with minor closures. I cant wait to return!",

                "review_text": "Extremely disappointed, and especially after experiencing Universal Studios Florida. The key issue I have is their express pass system, again, especially compared to USF/IoA. To me, express pass means paying a premium and being able to ride eligible rides over and over again. ESPECIALLY when there are only so few \"thrill\" rides at USS (Battlestar Galactica and Mummy from my perspective). However, the express pass is only eligible ONCE per attraction. If that couldn't get any worse, it's also only available on SELECT attractions. That's insane, given how small the park already is. In my opinion, the worst part about this park is the staffing. For example, in the Accelerator (teacup ride), there was ONE staff overseeing everything, including line management, scanning express passes, checking safety belts (!!), operating the attractions and announcements. The same issue was prevalent with other attractions too, which meant longer wait times, let alone risk to safety. Poor staff too, overworked with so many responsibilities that should be split. Genting Singapore, do better. Once Minion Land opens, I think this is an OK park for first-time Universal goers. However, I don't recommend going to USS at ALL for anyone who has experienced other Universal parks, especially the parks in Florida. That said, the food was generally good for a theme park. The chicken wings and biryani at Oasis Spice Cafe (next to Mummy) was really good. The Discovery Food Court (Jurassic Park) was OK, but overshadowed by such an inefficient checkout process.",

Lastly, the two most attractive roller coasters were closed for the first 4 hours of our visit.

Maybe it's because there are a lot of Chinese people in Malaysia, Singapore, and people of Chinese descent, so it seems like everyone is in a holiday festival mood... Perhaps because of that, there were breaks in the restaurant and there were many changes to the schedule. From the monorail waiting line to Sentosa Island... How long.. ah.. it was really hard. Visiting Universal Studios after several years.. Before that, I went to Japan, and this time to Singapore... It's okay to go to Singapore without an express ticket. I saw the post, there were so many people... The attraction with the shortest waiting time is 30 minutes. I thought there would be no answer if I waited like this. Express purchase available for one ride per attraction. 140 Singapore dollars per person.. 150,000 Korean Won.. Time is bought with money.... This was my first experience purchasing an express ticket. Since the waiting time for popular attractions is 80 to 100 minutes, I couldn't find an answer. There were places where I had to wait 30 minutes for the express line, and anyway, I rode everything I could. Legal cutting in line...Express... I came this far to get on one, but I was so mad at waiting for an hour or two... In the end, I think I did well anyway... Because it's less difficult for my family... Above all, a child who likes to ride amusement rides Proving once again that laughter is worth the money. It was a bit disappointing that the Minions area was closed for maintenance, and Singapore Universal was definitely smaller... There wasn't as much to see as I thought... Anyway, I think I did everything without regrets. I don't think I need to come back again.... Above all, Singapore is so expensive that it is easy to It seems like a difficult tourist attraction to come by.",

USS here is super popular with Indian tourists, I think they make up 70% of today's crowd ba. This is my 3rd time here already. My 2nd time was during at later stage of COVID with my whole family but as told by the staffs there because of COVID, there were no showtimes, and because of raining, no rides. So in the end we all forfeited ten tickets without entering. 1st time was 2012-2013, only had 2 rides due to crowd. The Shrek show 4D is very good and the only best experience we had thru out. We at minionland and approached a staff on the pathway to ask him where to redeem the gift. He told us to go entrance's shop to redeem. The the staff at the shop say not his shop, need go minionland shop. Sighhhhhhhh ok, went back the minionland shop, redeemed 4pc of minion stickers each, gave it to some random kid. _ Waterworld is closed, disappointed but they did put up a notice on the website. But the staff guarding the entry was kinda rude to other tourists. The donkey live staff during the queue will shout at you if you bring in drinks, but funny, the entry staff never say anything. Why must shout leh? We just beside the staff only when he walked passed, maybe only 1 man in between us. Jurassic Park, the ride with the water slide thing, forget it, don't bother to queue anymore if it's drizzling. Came up alot of problems like Flooding? Technical issue? Undergoing inspection? Funny thing is, early in the day time, we were \"forced\" by the older female staff with short hair to lock our 1 sling bag in the locker before queuing. We locked our bag in the locker at the Mummy ride there since it's free. When they allow queuing after the rain,suddenly everyone can just dash in without locking anything in the lockers. The staffs were so rude if I were to compare to USJ, totally no feels at all. Kept shouting and shouting, like \"GO TO ANOTHER RIDE, THERE OPEN\" \"DONT CROWD HERE\" \"NOT OPEN\" \"CLOSED\". Even until exiting the USS, staff just yell \"JUST GO\" if you don't walk fast to exit. Before that, his \"thank you\" so soft that I think I hallucinating that he was speaking Japanese. All staffs dont smile at all, maybe only the auntie who is cleaning the tables at the eating area beside the fried chicken shop, only she smile and tell us kindly to chop out seat, and also the uncle in the mummy ride locker who assisted us to unlock our locker AFTER GETTING STUCKED FOR NOTHING over an hour at the Jurassic park water ride there. He never smile but at least he's kind and not shouting at us. In summary, ruined mood.",

They should give visitors, at least the 1st 20 or so in the queue a food or express voucher. 2nd ride, the same thing happened AGAIN. This time, my group were supposed to be the next batch but there were technical difficulties too. While we were thankful that we weren't left hanging in the air like the batch before us, it was definitely very unpleasant. Again, there was no initiative for service recovery at all! I had to request for express tickets while explaining my situation of having about 2 hrs wasted in between these 2 rides. It's difficult to get the staff attention too. They avoided eye contact, walked away from me. They ALL were deemed bz 'helping' with the situation. Even though 1 or 2 was just looking 'bz'. An art which was frustrating to witness. There was another ride that was slightly delayed with technical issues again, but thankful, it was simply just a short 10min delay. Surprisingly, it wasn't crowded on a CNY Sunday afternoon. Not much tourists. I guessed for local visitors, not many will visit again if they have the same experience like me. Don't think I will visit for the next 5 years.",

It will be more fun if you wear a raincoat and sit in the front rows. If you don't want to get wet, choose the back. It takes around 30 minutes. 2) Transformers - It was a nice experience to feel the action in the movie. 3) Light Camera Action - 4) Roller coasters are available at many events. The latter are below par. 5) Shrek - 3D cinema more suitable for children 6) Sesame Street - more suitable for children 7) Mummy - we can say that the tunnel of horror is a fast roller coaster. 8) Puss in boots - Kid-friendly roller coaster. 9) Dinosaur adventure - A boat trip where you're likely to get wet. Your shoes may get wet, take precautions if you are going to ride. The organization and employee behavior were not good, we did not like it. It's annoying when events keep crashing.

As the handle smells of a lot of sweat. Suggest to put a BIG sign to not bring phones or bags, otherwise the poor person at the front have to keep repeating himself or herself before scanning everyone with the handheld metal detector. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure: the ride itself is interesting and fun for my kid but the handles need maintenance work as well, it was sticky and slimy Shrek 4-D adventure: the show was good but i feel like more can be done to ensure that there is order. Lots of foreigns squeezing and pushing their way through to their desire seats even though we were queuing to enter the row already. Maybe ensure that there are lines on the floor for people to queue so that they go to the row that they are lining up for. We went for some other shows, which are generally good but overall as a local, I dont think i will not bring my kids or even think about going to USS again. As the rides need maintenance, the toilets are not exactly designed with young children with strollers. The crowd there are mostly non-local and little more rowdy.",

This time, I went on a public holiday, whichbig mistakethe crowd was insane. Lines were already crazy long the moment I arrived at 11 AM. I thought I could handle the wait, so I lined up for Accelerator (the spinning yellow ride). After 30 minutes of barely moving in line, I gave up and got the Express Pass for SGD 140which, by the way, you can buy on the spot. It definitely helped, cutting down wait times significantly. Most rides took around 10 minutes max with Express Pass, while the regular queue was easily 3045 minutes at best, and for some rides, even up to 2 hours. Puss in Boots with an Express Pass? Still took an hour, so yeah, be prepared. That being said, USS is still a fun experience. My top recommendations? Revenge of the Mummy (a great indoor coaster with cool effects), Transformers (always a solid choice), Human vs. Cyclon (for thrill-seekers), and Lights, Camera, Action! (surprisingly entertaining). If you like Jurassic Park, definitely check out Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (prepare to get soaked) and Canopy Flyer (a fun suspended coaster with a great view of the park). With the Express Pass, I managed to finish all the must-ride attractions by 3 PM, which made it feel worth it. If youre visiting on a peak day, just be prepared for long queues or consider getting an Express Passthough it doesnt always mean instant access. If you prefer a more relaxed experience, going on a weekday might be the way to go.",

I waited 30 minutes for the Minions ride only to be told it was down. I then lined up for the Sesame Street ride for 15 minutes, and it was also under technical problems. The waiting times for some rides were incredibly long, yet the actual ride durations were less than a minute. Most of the attractions felt boring and didnt live up to the excitement I expected, especially when compared to Universal Studios in LA. While I understand the park is smaller, Ive had much more enjoyable experiences at smaller parks like Hong Kong Disneyland, where the rides are far more entertaining. Overall, I left feeling disappointed and unlikely to return.",

We stood for 40 minutes on one attraction, and it closed right in front of us! For inexplicable reasons. The other attraction had almost the same thing, but they still opened it.

The park was overcrowded, and the overall experience felt underwhelming. There was nothing particularly special about it, and it lacked the magic and excitement we expected from a major theme park. To make things worse, the park closes around 7 PM, with no night shows or special eventsjust a dull and abrupt ending to the day. The heat was also unbearable, reaching at least 40C, and there was no air conditioning in indoor areas. Instead of offering a break from the extreme temperatures, the enclosed spaces felt suffocating. Navigating through the packed crowds in these conditions made the visit exhausting rather than enjoyable. Compared to Disneylandwhich weve visited three times and loved every timeUSS doesnt even come close. The lack of proper facilities, entertainment, and overall mediocre experience make it completely overrated and not worth the visit.",

The roller coasters are poorly organized, the route is ridiculous and, with the exception of one, simply not worth the time. Maybe I'm just not the target group. The entire park organization is also deficient in many areas. On a rainy day, the air conditioning runs so cold that it becomes uncomfortable to go indoors in wet clothes. The milkshakes are so cold that you're more likely to chew ice crystals. In terms of price/performance: The food is simply not worth the money. Especially for Singapore conditions. This was the worst meal of my entire trip so far. So, onto the good things: The decoration is really well done. The facades in the streets are lovingly and detailed. The best ride in my opinion was Revenge of the Mummy. Good storytelling. I can completely advise against Puss in Boots. This is an absolute stop and go ride with no flow. The park has real potential that it is wasting in so many places, so it's a real shame. I'm leaving again after about 3 hours. I was really looking, I was really looking forward to the park but all in all it's more of a 3 classic park with a name",

I am writing to share our recent experience during our visit to Universal Studios on Monday, April 14, 2025, which, unfortunately, turned out to be quite disappointing due to repeated technical issues across multiple attractions. Our day began with a long waitover an hour and a halffor the Transformers ride. Just as we finally boarded the ride vehicle, we were asked to disembark due to a technical issue. We waited an additional 30 minutes in hopes of resolution, but another issue occurred, and the experience had to be paused again. Next, we visited the Shrek Fairy Tale Castle attraction. After a considerable wait and a 2025 minute pre-show briefing, we were again told that a technical issue had occurred and the experience could not continue. Later, at the Jurassic Park splash ride, we waited over an hour in line. Unfortunately, as we reached the boarding area, we were once more informed of technical difficulties, which caused another lengthy delay before the ride was operational. In total, we were only able to experience three rides and one show during the entire day. Given that the park closed at 7 PM, it left us with very limited time to enjoy what we had planned. We understand that occasional technical issues are inevitable, but experiencing this level of disruption throughout the day was genuinely disheartening, especially considering the cost and effort involved in planning the visit.",

However, the Express Pass doesnt work for some of the most popular rides or the newest zones (currently, its the Minions area). 4. Many rides are not allowed for kids shorter than 122125 cm.

I advise you to download an application where attractions, waiting times, and show times are recorded. Very convenient. Universal. And you can even make a plan in advance. What you will do and what you wont. But whats inconvenient is standing in line. Sometimes it takes a long time. We had 2 cases - we were standing, but as a result the attraction was broken. Perhaps in the morning it is better to go to the rides that are in the middle - because everyone will break down either on the first or last rides. In general, look at the queues. At lunchtime everyone usually goes out to eat. You can come at this time too. Take some water with you and something to snack on (especially for a child). Caps, glasses, spf. It's fun to walk around, but this ill-conceived waiting system is depressing. Too many people are launching. Well, at least there are different airflows almost everywhere while waiting You can buy a fast track ticket - then your waiting time will decrease I dont recommend watching the show with Puss and Boots. Better spend this time on something else. The child is happy. I would like more. Not all rides were ridden. Because there were queues and it was scary somewhere.

A couple of issues we had that I thought are worth mentioning, in case it helps someone else! * No re-entry is allowed. This was disappointing for us as a HUGE storm came across & closed down every ride, for quite some time (over an hour by the time we left & not looking like easing anytime soon). When all you can do is take shelter inside a shop or restaurant (however most of these are largely outdoor seating areas), it would have been great to able to get the Sentosa Express back to HarbourFront & get dry/fed & be able to go back once the weather cleared. Instead, we just left & didnt go back. * Waterworld was closed when we were there, this happens, I get it. The Minions ride broke down as my kids were queuing for it, with no re-opening time available. Given the cost of tickets (its not a cheap day out!) & putting up with things like this, I really think a re-entry option for weather, as stated above, would be a great gesture of goodwill. * Ride operators arent really behaving in the spirit of the place. One girl working the Transformers ride made our children completely exit the queue area because they had accidentally used the express lane without an express pass... only thing is, they were the only people in both the express & the ordinary lane. Doesnt set a great tone to the day when staff cant show any kindness to a group of children who arent inconveniencing anyone else.",

We purchased our ticket the day before while visiting Sentosa. Make sure the date mentioned is correct though, the staff made a mistake in our tickets by putting the day to the same day we bought them and the only reason we could still get the date fixed the day after is because we could prove that we purchased the tickets the day before late in the afternoon. Tip1: We were right in not purchasing the express pass (which saved us a lot of money!): the trick is to arrive early and go straight away to the most popular attractions that usually get busy very quickly. Between 10am and 11:30am, we were able to do everything we wanted with a maximum wait of 15mins. After that, the waiting time reached 100mins in some attractions, so we could take our time having lunch and wandering until we could go back to the popular attractions that got less crowded from 3pm onwards. FYI: you can always pay for an express pass on the spot but note the cheaper pass only allows you to use it ONCE per attraction and NOT all attractions! Tip 2: go light as the lockers youll have to rent for some attractions are rather small. Tip3: dont listen to the staff who pushes you to pay for a locker for the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure because youd get 80% wet . It wasnt true, we got barely wet and ended up paying for nothing. Tip4 (its 100% personal): as a parent of a 7 yo and a toddler, I was glad I didnt bring my youngest because she wouldnt have enjoyed it as much. My eldest however had such a blast and it was really fun and thrilling for his age. There were many families with very young children (below 6) and I found the choice for the latter quite limited and not as interesting because they would have had as much fun with all the free parks and such already available in Singapore. That really is up to everyone of course. Tip5: dont forget your physical passport for the tax refund which is right before you exit the park. All in all: we had a blast, the kiddo had fun, we could enjoy the attractions early in the morning before the crowd and we left with a lot of merch in our shopping bags. :)",

My favorite attractions was the movie simulation and transformer. Its very fun and i had a great time with my gf overall. However there were so many people from india, pretty much 50% if the tourist there is from india. I dont have a problem with that, but a lot of them have really terrible body odor, so maybe it would be great to install some fragrance and air con during in the attraction line area. Its can be very unpleasant to smell during the wait",

First of all there were long queue in front of us and we werent sure which Q we are supposed to wait. There should have been proper Q ribbons extending all the way to manage the Q and provide proper labeling for each Q. This would help for newcomers as we do not want to end up in the wrong queue and waste a lot of time. Even we were a family, we were provided three separate QR codes each in a separate e ticket file. We ended up spending lot of time opening the unique qr code and gaining entry. Our child was in a stroller and they made individual persons to walk across the entry gate one by one which I have never seen in any other place. While doing that my childs stroller got stuck in between the gates and I had to forcefully pull it out. This could have been avoided easily. Little did we know this was beginning of our disappointments in the so called popular over hyped amusement park. Once we downloaded their mobile app, we got to know the dreaded wait times. Some rides had 150 minutes (2.5 hours) !!!! Really ?? There is no point in reaching early or trying rides during lunch hours. The number of visitors are so huge, it doesnt make any sense. Do you want us to spend the whole day just for one ride? You need to be really crazy to wait hours for just one ride. There must be some rides dedicated for kids. Here in minion park, adults were doing merry go round. Though wait time was shown as 30mins we waited for more than 1 hour for a ride of hardly 60 seconds. Also USS should take example from river wonders in Mandai and provide proper shades as it is really difficult to roam around in scorching heat. Except for the Revenge of the Mummy and Transformers rides, I didnt find other rides any different from the ones we see in usual parks. Also USS doesnt understand capacity. They are just allowing infinite number of visitors to this place which isnt large enough to hold all of them or entertain them. You have queues even to get food or drinks or snacks or anything. Coming to the shows, they are all sub standard. We have witnessed much better shows in universities or malls. To top it all, water world show was closed due to maintenance. My final advice to everyone looking forward to visiting USS, if you have already been to any amusement park in your country/city, this place is not worth your time and money. You can make better use of this whole day by visiting some other place. This whole place is just over rated and I would never recommend anyone to visit this place.",

We had an unpleasant encounter with a staff member named \"Cedric\" (as shown on his name tag). He scanned us with a handheld metal detector and directed me toward the right side of the queue. My girlfriend, who came after, was unsure of where to queue due to the lack of clear signage and accidentally entered the express queue. We looked back at him and he corrected us. However, we then heard a remark right after (either directed at us or him speaking to his colleague) that had an extremely sarcastic and rude tone, that went along the line of \"Already say queue that side right?\" which was so uncalled for and made us feel disrespected. We hope this feedback can be used constructively, perhaps as a reminder to ensure all guests are treated with basic courtesy.",

We quickly went to the back of the park so we could go rafting and ride the not-so-rewarding Jurasicpark roller coaster. Otherwise, we only had enough for a whopping two screenings, as the waiting times shot up to 2.5 hours! There is only an overpriced Fast Pass and no virtual waiting lines, as we know from Europa Park, for example. We also noticed negatively the employees who, in a very unsympathetic way, made room for the \"Raptor\" appearance in the Jurasic Park area. In general, the way you can use photos to show characters like Shrek and Co is also not nice. You stand in line for ages and are pushed through by the employees in a rude tone. We've been to Universal Studios in Hollywood before. In contrast, the Singapore branch is an absolute joke. The 2nd star is only given for the Steven Spielberg special effects show. All in all, unfortunately by far the worst amusement park I've ever been to.",

But its difficult to overlook the lack of organization and indifference shown by staff during our visit, especially at the very start of the day. Upon arriving at the park entrance, I witnessed a frustrating incident in the Express lane: a few individuals were standing in line without tickets, claiming their friends were buying them. Staff allowed them to hold a place, and soon after, a large groupmore than ten people cut the line to join them. Only a few individuals were initially holding the spot, and none of them had even purchased entry tickets when they started queuing. When the rest of the group arrived, a staff member briefly told them to go to the back of the line, but then stood by and allowed them to stay once they pushed their way in. To make matters worse, I was asked to move aside to make room for them, even though I had followed all the rules and had a valid Express Pass. The handling was unfair, inconsistent, and felt like the louder you were, the more you got away with. I later sent a formal complaint via email, only to receive a generic and dismissive response that read more like a script than a genuine reply. The tone was cold and impersonal, showing no willingness to acknowledge the staffs mishandling or take any meaningful responsibility. It felt less like an effort to resolve a guest concern, and more like a gesture to defend their staff while avoiding accountability. I want to be fair: I did enjoy many parts of the park and appreciated the efficiency of the Express system itself. But much of the experience was tainted by what felt like an unwelcoming, mechanical attitude among staff. Id estimate that at least 60% of the employees I encountered looked visibly unhappy or disengaged with their work. The park has potential to deliver a great experience, but they seriously need to address crowd control, staff morale, and basic guest fairness. Without the Express Pass, this wouldve been a very different and likely much more frustrating day.",

I was one of the earliest people to get on too. -The ticket price was still full price even though some major attractions like Transformers: The Ride and Waterworld were closed. No discounts offered. -Waiting time not accurate. -Some rides, like Canopy Flyer, suddenly broke down and we had to wait ages for them to fix it. The staff didnt take the initiative to explain things. -The park closed early at 7PM. The lights had just turned on and everything looked so nice for photos, but we had to leave. No light show, water show, or fireworks either. -The Q system was ok la.. but there were no chairs. Standing for so long was exhausting! -The restaurant was too crowded and the food was just ok. Tips if Youre Planning to Go: -Get there before 8.30AM to avoid the crowds and long queues. -Bring your own water bottlethere are refill stations. -Check the Sentosa website for maintenance updates, opening hours and etc. -Hit the popular rides first, and then pick ones with shorter waiting time as you go. -Always check the weather forecast beforehand, even if its not 100% accurate. -Do some research and read reviews or other peoples experiences before buying tickets and planning your day. -Go on weekdays and avoid peak months and public holidays. Overall: This is my first theme park, but I think it might be average compared to others. Thankfully, I didnt run into any really serious problems like some others did. Despite the issues, I still managed to enjoy myself but i'm still sad that Transformers: The Ride was closed that day (i can't changed my fixed date ticket) y",

The queuing time for each attraction is much shorter compared to Universal Studios in other countries. The longest queuing time is forty minutes, but only for individual projects. Moreover, there is a limited park - Hello Kitty that is not available in other countries. The Sanrio characters in it are particularly cute and good-looking. I bought a lot of goods, and if there are any unsatisfactory quality issues, you can return or exchange them at any time with the receipt. Especially, an intern clerk named \"Joycelyn\"mylamerilyn has a particularly good service attitude. She is serious in her work and has a good attitude.

                "review_text": "Amazing place. I came here with my nephews and they really enjoyed the time here. Staffs are so nice and friendly to kids. Highly recommended for parents living in Asia. Location: you can take MRT to Harbour Front station and then take Sentosa Gateway to Universal Studio gate (Google Map, as the time I wrote this review, is not really accurate for the route from downtown) Environment: all facilities are tailored to serve kids well so nothing to worry about Price: a ticket for an adult 76 SGD, a pack of popcorn 9 SGD, a cup of smoothie 6 SGD, not cheap but still ok during summer time. The ticket price is arbitrary depending on seasons. Service: Service and user experience are all impressive. The only problem is you need to line up for more than 1-2 hours for each attraction unless you buy Universal Express. Best practice for new comers( me have visited in California, Osaka and Singapore) 1. Sandals, shorts, and t-shirts are best dress code for enjoying universal studio. Singapore is hot in most of time so the dress code will help. (And sandals will keep your feet dry after playing Jurassic World boat) 2. Buy tickets online to save your time from hours line-up. For example, klook. 3. Go hot attractions first when getting in. They will take most of your time. Googling some suggestions from internet beforehand will help - my suggestion is Transformer - Jurassic World - Water World (fixed schedule) - and the rest. 4. During summer time, even weekdays are full of people. However, its still better than coming here in weekends. This place is awesome and sincerely hope everyone have a good time here!",

I will suggest from Tuesday to Thursday as there are less crowds on these days. They do not allow any outside foods so be careful. Please purchase ticket online or from travel agent as it will save time in waiting lines. Make sure you are there on gate open time.

Entire Singapore is well connected by MRT and other mode of public vehicles. So if you want to visit Universal Studios in a pocket-friendly way, then opt for MRT and bus. Cabs are bit expensive in Singapore. You can buy the entry tickets online or can buy it from from local tour operator shops to avoid the huge que at Universal Studios. Even most of the times online tickets are cheaper than onsite tickets due to various promotions. Ticket cost for adult is S 79 and the child between 4-12 years will have to buy S59 ticket for 1 day trip. Try to reach there at the earliest to enjoy all the shows and rides. Monday to thursday it remains open from 10am to 7pm. The timings for Friday and Saturday are 10am to 10pm when Sunday it closes little early at 8pm. You should follow the map to explore all the places. Due to time constraint, I couldn't go to Sentosa. However if you have time then I would advice you to explore all the places at the same time. For going to Sentosa you can opt for cable car or Monorail (Sentosa Exppress). There are various shopping outlets and restaurants inside the campus. I bought a big transformer water bottle and they gave me the coupon to fill my 2 ltr. bottle with cold drinks from any of the restaurant. I did my breakfast near Transformer and had my lunch opposite to Jurassic Park and I found the food of the second one is tastier than the first one. Although everybody describes the roller coaster as the most dangerous ride of Universal Studios, however I found the ride at Revenge of the Mummy more scary. You should try to wrap up everything as early as possible otherwise you will not be able to cover each and everything. Time flies here very quickly. It has wheel-chair accessibility in most of the places and the staffs are very helpful and ready to assist you wherever it requires.",

Starting early, as soon as the gates open is a good way to begin.The crowd at night is less though. A map of the park, is a necessity, to plan out your trip. The three best rides are the cylon, mummy and transformer rides, which attract the longest queues. Some of the rides need you to be empty handed and with empty pockets. Locker facilities are available at various point, in case you don't have someone waiting outside. During my last visit, frequent failures of rides occurred, some where people had to wait in the rides to be retrieved..... Probably a one off. Nothing new added over the years. Good for one visit, nothing to come back to except the cylon rides. Good idea to take an express pass to reduce the wait time in queues. The express passes are available at most shops within Universal studios, but a few attractions are excluded from the express pass. Photographs are available at each ride and cost about 20SGD a piece. The restaurants are crowded at meal times, so it's a good idea to eat a little early if you want to avoid a long wait to order and get seating. The small food and beverage stalls don't accept cards but only cash. It can get dehydrating during the day, especially in summer, so these are usually the stalls where you can top up. The parades are entertaining for young children and those young at heart, so you can time your rides and visit based on the parade timings.",

Adults can try doing the roller coaster Battlestar Gallactica, indoor coaster Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park Ride on the boat and Transformer 3D Ride. Restrooms, coffeeshops, food shops and resort's staffs are everywhere. This is a must visit resort in Singapore. Come hurry and enjoy the show and ride. To top all of these, the resort is actually clean! That is what Singapore is known for right? Cleanliness. Entrance fee - 75SGD if you buy here at USS. But dont forget to check Klook for lower prices and discounts. When entering Sentosa, dont buy tickets first because you can use your EZ link card. Thats my mistake. So dont be like me. Haha. per Meal budgets should be 10Sgd above. Dont forget to bring coins. They also offer single ride options if you dont mind riding solo or separated from your group. This is actually works fine for me because the queue here is alot shorter than the regular or group one. If you dont want queueing for an hour or two, you can check express tickets online, maybe 60Sgd. Im not sure about this but you can check online.",

I would like to discourage you from purchasing an express ticket here. Basically, I don't know much about Transformers and its name, but if you ride a roller coaster and then ride a Mummy, I think most adults will enjoy it. If you are traveling with children, there are quite a few rides that children will enjoy, so I think it is not a bad idea to purchase an express ticket only if you are traveling with children. If you have belongings or bags, you can leave them in the lockers for the roller coaster and Mummy and use the attractions. It is free for about 2 hours at a time and you have to pay after that, so if you are visiting with a group of people, you can keep using the lockers for free if you take turns using them, so make good use of them. Uniquely, in the case of Singapore Universal, you can only leave and re-enter once, so if you need to eat, we recommend going out to Vivo City, eating there, and then coming back. The food at Universal was truly terrible. It's not that wide, so even if you move around a lot, you can enjoy it in half a day. One thing that was disappointing was that there were a few times when we had to wait to ride the attractions, but many people from India would cut in line with people of all ages, so it was very frowned upon.",

The various sections within the park cater mostly to the youger ones but honestly, it's just as fun no matter what age you are. And for the thrill-seekers, there are a few rapid, heartstopping rollercoasters - most of which I'm too afraid to try! There are many tame rides and entertaining shows with certain timings around if you're not one to seek out the thrilling sort of rides so definitely look out for those!

Theres probably 3 rides worth a mention and thats the two roller coasters and the Transfomers ride. I guess smaller children would also like some of the themed children rides like Shrek and Jurassic Park. I suggest booking your tickets online as the ticket purchasing at site is pretty slow. We went both times early morning and in the evening. All the rides were working from 7pm onwards and surprisingly not as crowded compared to the morning openings. If youre finding Singapore a little boring as we did then give this place some consideration.",

There are a few rides and places you must visit. 1) Start with Madagascar. Everything here is suited for kids above 80cm. 2)Take the Crate adventure ride, it is a relaxing and fun ride to warm the kids up to the place. Next, hop on to King Julien's Beach Party go round with is a simple carousel ride that parents can accompany. Most stuff at Madagascar are weather proof so even if it rains, u can go for these. 3) Next, go forth to to visit Far Far away cos that is where shrek lives haha. Up the challenge by taking the kids on the Enchanted Airways. Kids need to be 92 cm to take this gentle (not really for some, our girl hated this ride) roller coaster ride. It is exciting and SHORT. Less than 2 mins and it is over. Some boys may love this. So worth a try. 4) Go watch shrek 4D adventure. long queue but moves fast and for the time you queue, u get to spend at least 15mins seated down in a cool and comfy environment. Whn you exit, u will end up at the Fair God Mother potion factory, there is a tiny ferris ride here which u can q for. Tons of stuff to buy and u can have food at friars cafe opposite. Do remember to check out timings for meet and greet. 5)Next visit The lost world. Not all rides are suited for your toddlers and preschoolers. Just queue for the Dino soaring another very gentle ride which all will love. 6)hop over to canopy flyer to up the excitement again. Minimum ht here is 92cm. 7)Shop at Jurassic store if your boy or man love dinosaurs. Ask for promotion. In Dec 2019, get 10 percent off when u pay with MasterCard. 8)End the day with a visit to Elmo at New York which is near to the entrance/exit. Plenty of areas for toilet breaks and you can rent prams if u need. Have fun!",

Universal Studios Singapore is a nice day trip in Singapore, with lots of rides and activities to do for everyone. In my opinion, USS is aimed more for visitors with younger children since most rides were mild and available for kids. Older kids or adults may not have as much fun with the limited rides aimed for them (Battlestar Galactica: Human v Cylon, Egyptian Mummy, Transformers 4D Ride etc.) However, the overall experience will be fun for everyone. Food stalls and Food Courts had limited food options, which may not be appropriate for some people. Also, food is reasonably priced, so you should eat in restaurants outside the theme park but in Sentosa. As always, decorations and designs of the streets were beautiful and well made. Stores for merchandise are nice, though the same goods have been selling for a while. Overall, you should definitely take kids to this scenic theme park. It is packed with a variety of attractions and will be a satisfying day trip to sentosa.",

Now with the rule of twos I'd encourage you to get a ticket as no families will be there. Do get the Universal Express pass - best 40 you will spend, as you reduce your queue time from 30-60 sweaty minutes to about 60 seconds. You can buy these all over the park. Don't go on the Transformers ride last, it will really turn your stomach something rotten...",

We brought our own water, pair of sunglasses and hats for the heat, as you will need to stay hydrated fairly regularly, shouldn't have brought the cameras as most rides don't allow loose bags and accessories and you have to check them in lockers. If you have express lane privileges think carefully where to use them. Highly recommended rides are the BSG cylon human rides, then Mummy, then Jurassic, then Transformer (Waterworld ride is closed), in that order. Long queues are expected EVERYWHERE. You might get stuck in the normal queues whilst Sentosa privileged expat kids whose parents have gotten them annual passes including express privilege pass you by. So do use that wait time to envy them and philosophically think about why you can't afford to do so. Also think about strategy, there're only 9 hours of opening hours, 2 hours to queue to buy and consume food, that leaves 7 hours for 5 major rides and other smaller ones, each ride lasts no more than 2 to 5 mins, can you afford 30 to 60 mins to queue for each ride... The rest are for younger kids so don't get stuck with parents with kids in the queue absolutely not worth it. Food wise, go for burgers or hot dogs, most eateries are closed so expect to pay premium. Always get a souvenir like a t-shirt or something to remember your visit by.",

Recommended rides ( From my experience) 1. Mummy (Animated roller coaster) 2. Jurassic park ( Canopy Flyer) 3. Transformer ( Soft and Simple yet fun) 4. Cylone and Human ( Hardest ones) Dont go for mummy safari its slow and mostly for toddlers There are many more but you need a lot of time, for maximum enjoyment visit during non rush season like January or April",

My 6yo at the time of writing, who was excited to try \"roller coasters\", told me that's scary enough. Worth buying the express tickets too especially if you arrive some time after it opens. Note there are rides that you can't use it on, so do check the USS website. When we went, the Canopy Flyer was one of them, but we got in at the start of the day so there was no queue.

But there are a few suggestions to help you: 1. Take a water bottle with you. There are plenty of places to refill it and it is important to drink a lot with the heat and humidity in Singapore. 2. Pay the extra money and get an Express Pass for each family member. The park is only open from 11.00 until 18.00. With wait times of up to 1.5 hours for some of the more popular rides, you will not be able to do all the rides in a day. The Express Pass will allow you to skip the queues and significantly decrease your wait times. If you want to enjoy all the rides in a day, this is vital. 3. If you only want to do a few rides, it is much quieter in the afternoon. Arrive after lunch and your wait times drop from 80 minutes down to 15, or even less. But choose which rides you want and plan ahead - they close entry to the rides at 18.00. 4. Things are expensive in the park. You will pay a lot for food and souvenirs. Don't be surprised, be prepared - take enough money to enjoy yourself. At least you will save a bit if you follow point number 1.",

As both my kids were first time riders of the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, both my wife and I assured them that we will sit with them separately on the ride and they can sit in the middle for added safety since they are dinosaurs fan, just not rides, but we thought we let them try and hopefully like it. For context, 2 yrs ago my girl was 6yo and she would freak out even taking the Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase! She literally cried out loud during and after the ride! Nevertheless, we indicate to the staff at the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure that we are of 2pax each (My wife with my daughter, and myself with my son) so that both kids can sit in the middle. We were assigned a ride which already has a family of 3, so both my kids took the remaining middle seats and both my wife and I sat by their side. However there's an adult couple whom came over and told us that they are of 2pax and would like to sit together as two. Despite explaining to the staff our situation, eventually my daughter was made to sit at the other side of my son's, while I'm at the other end. And my wife had to extend herself to reach over to hold my girl's hand to calm her even before the ride began. I in the end tried to hold both my son's and daughter's hand throughout. Regardless of our best effort, both of my kids screamed and cried throughout the entire boat ride! No thanks to the staff's arrangement! Don't understand why we have to make such arrangement even though my family had already agreed and indicated to split up. They could have assigned single rider to sit on each of the other remaining sides. In any case, my kids decided not to come to USS anymore in future, no thanks to you USS! Lest to say, that was our last ride of the day, as we didn't take any further rides and cut short our day and left shortly after.",

Things to keep in mind- better to fix a meeting spot and time with your family, as you are not allowed to carry phone and other items with you, so, tracking becomes an issue. Take a locker, keep your belongings there, fix a meeting time & spot, so, that you all can meet after a few rides....full day is needed, so, better to start early, carry a water bottle as you need to walk alot, so, staying hydrated is must. Wear sneakers or comfortable shoes, in which you can walk more and more....wear a cap and sunglasses, wear lot of sunscreen, as it is sunny most of the time and everyone in the family, keep some cash, so, that, even if you are away from other members, you can enjoy the yum food in Universal. A must in your Singapore trip, though we had been to Ferrari world- Dubai, but this surely was fun. *Tips- You can take an express pass, if you do not like to wait much and ready to pay double the price, Express que is separate, but relatively less waiting. We took the normal ticket and had to wait for 30-45min per ride.",

But neither are backpacks. When the mummy returns there is a single line. But if it is too full it will also be closed. I was there when the park opened and managed to ride Galactica seven times and the Mummy six times. After that the park became so full that queuing was no longer fun. I also really liked the 4D animation Shrek... all in all a very nicely laid out park but quite small. No comparison to Euro Disney Europapark or Parque Aventura in Spain...

Rides Are ok, if u have Vip access. Otherwise a 40 min queue for a 5 min-ride is, to me, not worth it. But that's just my opinion. Pls dont grill me for it..lol. Safety checks are excellent. Variety is good for all ages. Location Easily accessible and plenty of spots for picture taking, especially by the docks..(Hollywood Area) good spots to chill with Waterview. Notes for travellers: Bring a mini fan(one that can be attached to phones or powerbanks). Be in nice-looking clothes that are light. It is Singapore, humid.

I don't mean a sprinkle but downpour that an umbrella can't save you. (We loved it) The big rollar coaster takes forever to board compared to any roller coaster in the world and wins the worst smell on the b.o que. The mummy attraction is the best and a must do. Transformers was the popular attraction with a 50 min wait in September. The food was good and fresh for a theme park. (Keywords theme park) The cookie monster desserts were good. Other rides it was 10 to 30 min wait so not bad at all. Alot of cute photo ops. If you have kids, there is plenty to do. However, remember to plan around in case a surprise rain shower happens. Rain can be unpredictable in this climate and we knew that going in. Ladies, bring pads especially if you are late or think you skipped. They do not have anywhere or near the park.

The Queues are so short ( maximum 30 minutes). Both my kids loved the rollercoasters and were very sad to go home. There is a large variety of rides from slowly and small to extreme and fast which were perfect for kids any age. The food is so cheap and very tasty and we had lots of fun buying some souvenirs at the many shops. I hundred percent recommend this place and if you just read all of this: DO NOT GO THERE AND SAVE YOUR MONEY IT WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD!",

With fewer rides, lines were manageable even on a weekday, peaking at around 40 minutes and dwindling later in the afternoon. I highly recommend buying tickets online in advance, because it is slightly cheaper to do so and you can buy a combo ticket package with other nearby attractions. We didn't find a need to buy the Express pass to skip lines, but it may be very useful during the holiday season and weekends. Despite a brief interruption due to rain and lightning, the adjacent aquarium provided a convenient and enjoyable diversion. Food and drinks are on the pricier side, but stumbling upon an unadvertised happy hour for drinks was a pleasant surprise. The policy of free lockers for an hour, with reasonable charges afterward, adds a practical perk. The park's cleanliness and organized lines contribute to a positive overall atmosphere.

The map gained through scanning the qr code was a little help to plan to meet and greets, rides, and shows. Advised to bring ponchos or raincoats and a change so it saves cos not to buy a poncho and queue up for dryer. Sunscreen cream, if needed and water bottles, will be good. Kids below 122cm should always be accompanied by parents otherwise you can leave your little ones to have a little adventure.

The ride WORTH going is the transformers ride! It's very good and even me and my family went to ride it TWICE! don't worry about the height requirements of your child's cause even if they are short they just need to be accompanied by a Parent/Guardian. We finished most of the rides that we wanted to try by 7pm!

The weather is hot most of time, water refilling station is close to toilets or some designated locations. Some facilities are old with the renovation and some are brand new. Kids love transformers, minions and dinosaurs for sure. Queueing takes time for those pop and hot parks always. Be patient since some people do not enter the studio after 2 to 3pm. Just come and have 1 day tour for fun. Enjoy.",

I visited outside of the school holidays which definitely made the trip that much more pleasant and easy to navigate. Getting there via MRT was awesome. Another credit to the the super-efficient Singaporean government. And once you were in the Universal Studios park area, it seemed spacious, clean and lots to look at and do. There are so many rides (for all ages) and I have to say, I had a blast with my wife and seven year old son. One tip: pay for the premium ticket. Lines are long and it is worth every cent to not hang around and spend your time doing things. I ate at the Hawker's Market which was really inexpensive and actually pretty good.

My strong advise is to buy Express pass to avoid really really really long queues which may go from 60 mins upto 120 minutes in a intense humid day. Most rides are prioritised for Express pass holder which is really frustrating to wait and see them passing quickly and standard ticket holders being neglected and delayed almost in some rides. Pls be mindful that most of the big attractions are not for children below 4 years (height wise) so I dont recommend really to go with kids of that age as apart from gift shops, there is nothing really for them. For adults better buy a Express pass (allowed once per ride) or go alone in \"Single\" queue (incase allowed) as most of the time single queue is closed. One day is enough if u reach at 10am and come out at closing time. Overall the place is obviously great to be at. Rides to go for... 1. Jurassic Park Boat Ride 2. Revenge of Mummy Ride 3. Transformer Ride 4. Waterworld Hollywood Live show 5. Light Camera & Action Show",

The vibrant colors, iconic landmarks, and thematic music all contribute to an immersive atmosphere that captivates visitors from the moment they step in. It offers a wide variety of rides that cater to different age groups and thrill levels. The twists, turns, and inversions deliver an adrenaline rush that is hard to match. The Transformers: The Ride is an absolute highlight. This 3D dark ride combines cutting-edge technology with immersive storytelling to create an exhilarating experience that leaves you on the edge of your seat. For families with younger children, the Madagascar: A Crate Adventure boat ride and Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase offer fun and excitement without being too intense. These rides are beautifully designed with vibrant characters and engaging storylines, making them enjoyable for both kids and adults. The live shows at Universal Studios Singapore are not to be missed. The WaterWorld show, in particular, is a spectacular performance filled with high-octane stunts, pyrotechnics, and special effects. The cast is incredibly talented, and the show is packed with action from start to finish. Its a thrilling experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In addition to the shows, the character meet-and-greets are a big hit, especially with the younger visitors. Meeting iconic characters like Shrek, the Minions, and the cast of Madagascar adds an extra layer of magic to the day. The food options within the park are diverse, catering to various tastes and dietary preferences. Whether youre in the mood for a quick snack or a sit-down meal, theres something for everyone. The themed restaurants, not only serve delicious food but also add to the overall immersive experience. Prices are what youd expect in a theme park, but the quality and variety make it worth it.

Even on busy days, they manage the crowds efficiently, and the queues for rides move at a reasonable pace. Tips: Get there early to utilise full day and enjoy all attractions. The Express Pass can be a good investment on busier days, helping you skip the lines and enjoy more attractions. Dont forget to bring sunscreen, as much of the park is outdoors. Also, bring a pair of fresh clothes if youre planning on enjoying all water rides or buy ponchos from nearby stores in the park to protect yourself from getting wet. Most likely you will which is another kind of fun. A fresh pair of clothes will come in handy in these situations or if it rains.",

You wont find anything too extreme or thrilling, but the attractions are still engaging and fun for the little ones. What I did enjoy was the ambiance and how beautifully the park is built. The architecture and layout are thoughtfully designed, creating a charming and immersive atmosphere. The surrounding scenery adds to the overall experience, making it pleasant for a stroll even if you dont go on the rides. The pathways, landscaping, and themed areas really make the park feel magical, especially when taking your time to explore.

Some areas were closed possibly for maintenance rotation but that just puts more pressure on the remaining attractions. There are attractions for adults only, but none specifically for kids. So, strangely enough, I wouldnt really recommend going with children. Youll end up waiting almost everywhere, which is really tough for kids. There are no charging stations, so make sure to charge your phones and bring a power bank. Otherwise, you might end up in a situation like we did: our express passes disappeared, and we couldnt order a taxi, so we had to walk back to the hotel about 5 km because we didnt have any cash on us.

The park is beautifully themed, and seeing characters like the Minions and Optimus Prime in real life brings a genuine sense of wonder to young faces. My children were absolutely thrilled by the Madagascar: A Crate Adventure boat ride and the Puss in Boots' Giant Journey suspended coaster when they were actually running. Unfortunately, our visit was significantly impacted by ride closures. The tropical climate of Singapore meant that several outdoor rides were temporarily shut down due to rain, which is understandable. However, we were also disappointed to find a noticeable number of attractions undergoing maintenance, further limiting our options. This was a real shame, especially for my kids who had been eagerly anticipating certain experiences. Despite the reduced ride availability, there was still enough to keep us occupied for a good portion of the day. The shows were entertaining, and the various themed zones offered plenty of photo opportunities and character meet-and-greets. The Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, even with the potential for getting soaked, was a definite highlight for the whole family. Food and beverage options within the park are plentiful, albeit on the pricier side, which is to be expected in a theme park. The staff were generally friendly and helpful, doing their best to manage the crowds and provide information about ride statuses. Overall, Universal Studios Singapore is a good experience, especially if your primary focus is entertaining younger children. The park has a unique charm and some genuinely fun attractions. However, the high likelihood of rain-related closures and the potential for maintenance disruptions mean it's not a guaranteed seamless experience. Would I say it's a must-visit in Singapore? Probably not. While we had a good time, the ride closures dampened the overall value proposition. If you have limited time in Singapore and prioritize must-see attractions, there might be other experiences that offer a more reliable and complete experience. However, if you have a few days, are traveling with kids who are big fans of the Universal franchises, and are prepared to be flexible with your itinerary due to potential ride disruptions, then Universal Studios Singapore can be a worthwhile one-time visit. Just be sure to check the park's website for any scheduled maintenance beforehand and be prepared to embrace the possibility of rain delays.",

The outdoor dances, meet-and-greets, and other performances are incredibly engaging and well-executed. The Dinosaurs show is so realistic, it felt like we were witnessing actual prehistoric creatures! For children under 102cm, there are still plenty of opportunities to enjoy the shows from comfortable, stationary seating.

Far Far Away was a family favorite, with the Shrek 4-D Adventure and the impressive castle making everyone feel like part of a fairy tale. What made the day truly special was how the park managed to cater to all their ages so seamlessly. While the older kids got their adrenaline fix on rides like Battlestar Galactica and Canopy Flyer, there were plenty of fun, age-appropriate attractions for our youngest toolike King Juliens Beach Party-Go-Round and Dino-Soarin. We also appreciated the clean, family-friendly spaces, quick service, and the kindness of the staff. The kids didnt stop smiling all day, and we left with tired feet, full hearts, and a promise to come back again.",

Id highly recommend buying their VIP pass if you can afford it. Average waiting time for good rides is 30-60 mins. And standing in the queue tires you quickly in Singapore heat.

The park offers many attractions inspired by popular films, and its various themed zones mean that everyone will find something for themselves. Attractions for children This place was created for the youngest! Many attractions are adapted for children, and meetings with cartoon characters add magic to the entire visit. However, it is worth checking whether a given attraction is suitable for your child before entering - the staff does not always pay attention to this, which can result in an unpleasant surprise. Queues and VIP tickets Some attractions are very popular, which means long queues. It is possible to buy a VIP ticket, which allows you to use priority entry, but in my opinion it is not worth overpaying for this privilege - it is better to plan your visit to avoid the largest crowds. Rollercoasters and thrills The park offers amazing rollercoasters that provide a solid dose of adrenaline. Battlestar Galactica: HUMAN vs. is especially worth trying. CYLON, which is one of the most exciting rollercoasters in Asia. Planning your day and returning You can spend practically the whole day at Universal Studios Singapore, but it is worth leaving a little earlier to avoid long lines for the return train. The park is very dynamic - there are many shows and performances on the streets, so there is always something going on. To sum up, Universal Studios Singapore is a great place for a family trip, full of excitement and unforgettable attractions.

Don't miss the transformer's show which is a must watch. Please keep in mind that if you are visiting here on Sunday or holiday there will be lot of rush and you will not get all the rides and shows as waiting time will be very high. Better to go there in weekdays and reach there early. My top 5 attractions are 1. Transformers 2. Hollywood Studio 3. Madagascar show 4. The Roller coaster fast one and The Mummy 5. Dance show on road which starts around 5 pm. Also keep in mind to leave a little early from Universal Studios in the evening as waiting for taxies become very long and you have to stand in long queue for Taxi.",

There are lots of worlds inside it, each belonging to a different movie from the studios. The worlds, the attractions and the attention to detail is just amazing. There can be a lot of waiting time during peak season, such as when we went during Christmas week, so it is better to shell out a few extra dollars and buy a Fastrack pass which lets you skip the queues. In this way you can experience much more rides in a single day. There are also souvenir shops with really good, high quality merchandise, albeit pretty expensive. Same goes for the food. There are many restaurants and food stalls, but the problem was that there was very little or no vegetarian food options. Only the Indian restaurant in the ancient Egypt world had veg food. Even though Singapore does not have many vegetarians, universal studios is an international destination and must cater to the needs of all types of people. Anyway, packing some food from home is advisable if you want to save money. Also, Singapore weather is hot and rainy, so dress appropriately for that. They do sell umbrellas and rain ponchos there. Overall, the experience was amazing. One can spend a whole day here. We liked the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster, the Transformers 4d ride and the Mummy roller coaster a lot. The Water World show was crazy.",

I have visited 3 times there but still my urge for visiting there never ends. Universal studios: What can I say about this place! It is clean, wide, gorgeous, colorful and safe place to visit. Here the rides are well maintained, different branded shops and food courts are well maintained. People can enjoy a perfect vacation here and meet new people, culture and charms! My advice is to keep two consequent days for visiting universal studios. Theres several hotel around it but they are bit costly. Rather you can stay in the city as you can easily get there within an hour. This is the beauty of Singapore! I have visited many countries but Singapore would always remain my first choice to enjoy my vacations. Hope to visit there soon again!",

My two Singaporean children are foreigners and cannot upgrade to annual passes. Let us buy new tickets. These tickets were also sold to travel agencies by Universal Studios. Why are foreigners not allowed to apply for annual passes? They all buy the same ticket to enter the park. How come foreigners can do it but locals cant.

In terms of size and quantity, this is above European standards. That said, you also have to say that the park is really a lot of fun, awesome shows (best Waterworld! The stunt people do incredible things!) different areas and lots of nice sales shops, but here too the price-performance ratio is poor. Very good rides for children and adults who are young at heart, adrenaline and roller coaster junkies will find moderate rides here. Tip: Jurassic Park water ride, very good. And two hours before closing time is also great, as the waiting times are reduced by more than half compared to midday. Conclusion: a lot of money but also a lot of value for it.

Most favorites here is still the Transformers ride-that never vacant, but it's very worthed since these rides where very exciting!! but my favorite is still the Shrek-4D-Adventure which is hillarious!! _ we can also watch Light parade and see the Firework show is the near closing time. All the attractions here were well-planned for every customers happiness and excitements. so we would never get disappointed. You can also purchase many Universal-merchandise that is rare to find in any other places, like How-to-train-your-dragon merchandise which is soooo cool to collect. The only problem here is the heat, so very recommended to wear light shirt and comfortable shoes, or you might also bring fan and always carry a tumbler or you might get dehydrated. and on some season, weekends and public holiday do prepare to lining up for every ride. and i'm talking about a very-very long lines..

The Chinese girl came from afar. She didnt say she wanted to check her. She waited until people were about to pass and said loudly, Didnt you hear me tell you to queue up? Handsome guys and beauties with blond hair, blue eyes, all treat it as invisible and dont check. When they meet Indian compatriots, its just He gently inserted a small wooden stick into the bag and said you can go. Even a local teacher in Singapore who took primary school students to play was brutally investigated. It was like the airport. The Chinese female teacher was dumbfounded. Haha, by the way, the primary school students are all Chinese. The official website said you can bring snacks, but you got yelled at for bringing snacks. Maybe honey star is a staple food in the West, so she said no if you bring a small box hahaha The nice little snacks were generously given to the cinema staff. The Chinese female staff were dumbfounded and asked why they were so strict. They didnt even give it to them for the whole day. Their mood was affected. Second time, everyone, be careful. Chinese people should be careful. It is best to go empty-handed and leave this racist lunatic with nothing to say. Dont take it out on tourists. From the bottom of your heart, remind future tourists to take care of themselves and spend so much money. Is it really good to get such service?",

Buy the Express Ticket if you want to optimise your visit especially when you have teenage children who love the rides. Various mode of payments are available. There are a few new attractions. There are a few halal food outlets, clearly marked in the location map. I always took a bus from Johor Bahru into Singapore. From there, we took the MRT right up to USS entrance. We walked for a bit on the board walk. Interesting route with a lot of things to see on the way. For first timers, need not worry because you can follow the directions to get there provided on USS web page.",

People start lining up 30 minutes early, but you can enjoy unlimited rides on popular attractions until around noon. Even if it's crowded, you can ride it in about 30 minutes, so it's a good idea to ride as many attractions as you like. CYRON is the most popular, so you will be satisfied after riding it about 3 times. Also, CYRON, HUMAN, and MUMMY need to leave all their luggage. Leave it in a locker with fingerprint authentication. (You don't have to worry because the staff speaks Japanese and there are staff. Please carry a few dollars or a credit card just in case.) Jurassic Park gets really wet, so raincoats are a must. Also, there is a charge for lockers, so it might be a good idea to leave them at MUMMY. You can ride the train on Sentosa Island for free. Once you get out, you can see the giant Merlion or go to the beach. Once you leave, just tell them your ticket and \"Reenter\" when you exit, and your arm will be treated with a black light, allowing you to re-enter. Texas chicken and Mac are available in places where rice is served, so it's cheap. It's good to be relatively close. Although the scale is not large, the USS is a place you can enjoy to the fullest.",

Just have your ticket/eticket ready. There are no outside food or drinks allowed but they don't check your bags so... Accessibility: you can take the MRT to Vivo city and choose between the Sentosa express (SGD 4) a train at the top of the mall or Bus to Resorts world (SGD 1) still pretty accessible. FYI You can ride the express back for free. Check the weather forecast, the cheapest raincoat is SGD 5. And most of theroller coaster rides close due to rain. Buy your tickets beforehand at klook/kkday you can get a lesser price.",

Though a comparatively smaller theme park it offers some of the best rides. I would recommend you to go here if you are with friends or relatively younger people because some of the rides might not be for elderly people. Best Rides and thrill 1*. Waterworld stunt show - DO NOT MISS THIS SHOW BY ANY MEANS. 1. Battle star gallectica cyclone 2. Transformers ride 3. Revenge of the mummy 4. Jurassic park water ride ( wear a poncho ) 5. Shrek 4-D Here are the things that would be of help : - The normal ticket is priced at 79 SGD for adults for a single day pass. You can book a ticket online or through the counter as well. If you are staying in Singapore for more than 1 month i would suggest you to buy an annual pass priced at 169 SGD. - You do not have to pay anything extra for rides inside USS. - If you have a bigger budget for the tour i would recommend you to buy an express pass which is around 199 SGD. This pass helps you to bypass the long queues and helps finish the rides faster. - If you are planning to take a normal ticket and also want to enjoy all the rides try to come as early as possible at around 9 in the morning. We reached USS at 9:45 and could complete all the rides. - The food inside USS is very expensive and not tasty at all. Try to bring your own meal from home. Outside food is allowed. Indians can find Indian food in \"oasis spice garden\" food court near the mummy ride. - Try packing light and do not bring huge bags. The lockers inside are too small. - If you want a good picture in front of the iconic USS globe at the entrance try to come as early as possible or you can exit the park sometime in the afternoon or evening. Do not forget to ask for stamp if you want to re-enter. - The souvenirs and toys inside are too expensive. You will find better things in chinaTown. Take your children inside the toy shops at your own risk. I hope this information helps !",

For popular attractions, there may be a wait of 2 to 3 hours. With the pass, you can ride all the attractions in the evening and have time to choose souvenirs! However, I was disappointed that some attractions ended at noon. Personally, I think the water show is very authentic and worth seeing! I didn't really worry about attractions that said \"be careful not to get wet\", but I ended up getting very wet (lol). Are the regulars wearing raincoats? I was wearing. The food may be average or not what you would expect. Don't you need to clean up after eating? It seems OK to leave the dishes on the table as is. (There is no return slot) Singapore is a beautiful country, and perhaps because of its thorough cleaning, there was no trash left and I was able to enjoy my stay very comfortably.

On showing the tickets at the entrance they will give u a band/pass which will give entry to all rides and attractions inside the amusement park. Among all the rides I liked the roller coaster , mummy ride and transformer ride in the sci fi city. There are restaurants inside the park where one can have snacks or lunch. There is speilburgs studio which gives an idea on how VFX is used to give realistic view by using light and sound. Overall it's a great place for weekend destination in Singapore and it will take a day to explore all the things inside the park.",

Singapore Branch: It is very beautiful and I recommend visiting it, but its only drawback is the high entry prices! Especially when purchasing express boarding tickets . Its location in Singapore: on Sentosa Island, specifically at Resorts World Sentosa . The amusement park is divided into seven parts (Hollywood, Ancient Egypt, New York, Madagascar, The Lost World, The Future, and Fantasy Movie Celebrities) . What are the activities at Universal? - It contains 15 games (if I am not disappointed) divided between children and adults. - It has live shows, the most beautiful of which is (The Water Show), which is a very beautiful live action comedy film through which you can see how action films are made - It has the Hollywood Walk of Fame - You can take pictures with characters such as (Shrek and Princess Fiona - Pussy in Boots - Madagascar characters - Minions - Sesame World - Transformers) - There are gift and souvenir shops - There are (halal) restaurants, and I repeat the word (halal) because before traveling I asked and they told me to take food with you, there are no halal restaurants!! I was surprised by three restaurants with the (Halal) logo, even though I was not careful to search and did not see the rest of the restaurants. Maybe they are all halal after all (The restaurants I saw were halal: one in the fantasy films section, one in the Madagascar section, and one in the ancient Egypt section) . Experienced advice when visiting Universal: - It is best to visit it on other weekends to avoid severe crowding - Attend at the beginning of the day so that all the games can be played - Buy an express boarding ticket in case there is crowding, because the wait at the games is very long, reaching from half an hour to a full hour sometimes. - Ask about show times when entering . Prices: Large: 74 Small: 54 Express Boarding: Add 30 to the ticket, whether large or small . Working hours 10am - 8pm .

No touching, no shaking hands with them, and they'll let you stand at a line to selfie. Selfie sticks recommended.

The Middle Corridor sightseeing area. This \"#Merlion Tower\" is 37 meters high. It has a medium interior.

Beautiful views to the south. There is also a light show that you can watch at night. Its a pity that it needs to be rebuilt, so I cant bear to part with it. Its so dangerous.

Few tips I would like to share which I knew earlier which helped me a lot. 1. Bring some food. I would say a lot . You would be a very very hungry during all the rides and the food inside is bit costly 2. Take a big bottle of water. Be hydrated all the time. There is dispenser and wash rooms all over the place 3. Check your locker timing. After 120 minutes it's chargeable. So what you can do is takeout your stuff and place again with different a locker 4. Go for rollercoaster first. It will remain busy until the end. So be sure you make it there within the first few. Then comeback and enjoy the rest 5. I will suggest you take an express pass. But I found it useless if you are travelling alone or you guys have the vibe of going to every rides alone then you can save around 60 to 70 SGD. There is a line for single riders which is pretty quicker than express pass. But keep in mind it will not work in rollercoaster. 6. I would suggest you allways take someone with you so that you have someone who can take pictures for you since there is a lot to click. Also take a selfie stick which cost hardly 3 SGD. This also gives you a good company. 7. If rank then my order would be rollercoaster, mummy ride, transformers ride, Jurassic park ride, pic with talking transformers, minions, etc, pics in hollywood, newyork, etc. All above are my personal views from my personal experience yours might differ. Verdict : A day full of fun",

It combines adrenaline rush from roller coaster ride with the 4D tech. Super fun! Second to try is the Mummy and the Human Roller Coaster, if you have more guts then try Cylon.

Get to MRT station of Harbourfront and then a 5 minutes train directly to the park from Vivocity mall. 2) Price is just fair. 3) The park has a total of around 8 rides (some for kids and some for adults) in addition to some other activities (4D movies and etc.) 4) The park is convenient and quite small, so you can really have it covered in a full day. 5) The atmosphere and theme of the park are amazing. Everything is done really well and into the details. Some disadvantages: 1) Some of the rides might be closed randomly on days you come. You just have to find out(no worries though, the main ones are active) 2) I visited on a a moderately low day. In high season waiting can be over an hour and even longer for most rides. Honestly I dont think the most are worth waiting more than 45 minutes tops except for the top best rides. But thats a more personal thing. 3) The park is real fun, but having said point number 2, the best of the park really comes down to 3-4 rides (for those who love the adrenaline), which are always really busy and waiting is long. To sum up - Amazing experience, be prepared for some waiting on busy days. Dont miss it if you are in Singapore",

So, if someone gets dizzy easily, it's best to ask the staff first and choose a ride that's light. It is also recommended to bring an umbrella or something that protects your skin from the sun because during the day it is very hot but I didn't play the rides, I just took photos and just wanted to know and enjoy the nature in Singapore because the rides are quite expensive hihihi _",

It is really rare to have tsukemen in Taiwan. The first time I tried it, I really thought it was great. I both liked it spicy and numb. I chose the incremental line and added a portion of meat, but the meat was a bit deducted. Their barbecued pork is the three-layer fat type, but about half of the meat I got was a whole piece of fat... This is It's really a little disappointing, but the meat is very fragrant and delicious overall. It's just that I haven't eaten something so greasy in a long time. The dipping sauce is also on the oily side, and the meat is actually full of fat... I really feel like my femoral vessels are getting clogged after eating it. It feels like staying here, but fortunately the fried bean sprouts in the store are really delicious and not greasy. Otherwise, people who dont usually eat greasy food will have to think about it. Overall, the taste is very good, so you can come here. A store to try.",

It had some amazing rides based on several blockbusters like Transformers, Jurassic Park, Mummy etc. It has an amazing Roller coaster ride. You should get baby strollers as its quite a big place. You need atleast 8 hours to do it if you don't have an express pass. Rides waiting area gets too suffocated so keep your hand fans and water bottles along. They must improve on ventilation and must indicate time left in a que as it took us almost 1.5 hours to get a single ride. There are several branded gift stores where u can buy minion, hello.kitty, masgascar, mummy theme toys. It will cost you around 60 SGD per person for a day pass.Over all an amazing experience, a must visit place on your next visit to Singapore. On way back get the train and take cable car to have astonishing city views.",

Do not miss their special rides - Transformers, Ripples, The mummy ride and the 2 roller coasters. Book tickets in advance on Klook. Express entry tickets help you tour the entire park in a day's time, otherwise making it impossible to cover everything. If you're pressed for time, do opt for the express entry pass. Unless you're very keen on repeating rides, do not go for an unlimited ticket. Food options for vegetarians is very limited and equally expensive. We found an Afghani restaurant serving veg biriyani at SGD16 per plate! The number of restaurants inside the theme park seem to have significantly reduced over time, only adding to wait time and longer queues in the ones open. Keep some finger food handy for emergencies. Lots of options for souvenirs as well - every ride exit lands you into one! But the collection you find here is very unique and not available in the local markets of Singapore. So try to finish everything by 5 p.m and spend some quality time in these shops. Every ride, every shop and every eatery closes at 6 p.m sharp, so last minute hurry can be avoided with better planning. First time experiences at such places is always a good memory to cherish, enjoy yours while it lasts!",

There are lot of live activities by the characters themselves and allow you to click pics with them, with a good thing also being you can click using your own camera or phone as well apart from their official click. While their entrance ticket gives entry to pretty much all the attractions, a special pass called Express Pass will help you skip the long waiting lines of upto 40-60 mins on some of the attractions, especially the fast moving rides. You can buy the Express Pass over the counter which costs SGD 50 for one time use for applicable shows but can cost lesser sometimes if booked online.

But it was worth it.",

CYLON is the most craziest ride in USS. Start with mummy and then human or Jurrasic Park and then last CYLON if you still have the iron balls to do so. Get the express and it is a bloody worthy time saver. You can do more with express. USS needs a day entirely because SEA Aquarium closes at 5. Don't get both tickets for same day. Go visit all rides once you are in!",

You will enjoy the slides and pools here. Do not miss the chance to snorkel with the fishes! You can also get a bus ride to another part of Sentosa and try the Skyline Luge.

It seems that rides often break down, and in the case of popular Transformers and Mummy rides, it seemed like it would be really hard to wait unless you took the express. For souvenirs, we recommend stopping by the souvenir shop before entering Universal to look through them and then make your selection. Surprisingly, there were souvenirs that were only found outside. Food is a bit expensive, but it's acceptable considering it's the cost of not going out in hot weather. Meet and Greet is a must! I recommend watching at least one when you have the time. It's a little clumsy, but it's more fun than I thought.

The newly built \"Minion Park\" is expected to be completed in phases by 2025. However, there are already many Minions in the park, but I personally feel that the characters from Sesame Street are still the main attraction. Universal Studios Singapore is divided into seven themed areas: Hollywood, New York, New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, and Madagascar... Before the trip, I read on the Internet that there were relatively few people and queues on weekdays, but when I arrived at the venue, I found out, yes! Sure enough, the Internet cant completely believe itBut maybe everyone is comparing it to the standard of Universal Studios Japan after the lockdown is lifted. If so, I still agree... There are indeed a lot less people However, there are still many things worth seeing inside. People who like to visit amusement parks in Singapore can still visit here!",

The traffic flow is not properly arranged, many people cut in line, which is disappointing There are many drinking water places in the park, but there is water everywhere. A fly in the ointment The food area inside is so expensive that you can understand that it is an amusement area after all. A vending machine with a large sales volume The park will not help to deal with the failure, it feels like a tiger eating dumplings Since it is located in the tropical zone, the park is not very big. Can't we do more sunshade or cooling? Not only is it inconsiderate, it also makes people feel like they are trying to rob you of your money. Although it is the second time, I feel that there is no improvement I hope I can have the motivation to come back later. Universal Studios Singapore is the second Universal Studios in Asia, second only to Universal Studios Osaka. It is also the smallest Universal Studios in the world with the cheapest tickets. Universal Studios Singapore covers an area of 20 hectares and took three years to build. It is the only movie theme park in Southeast Asia. It is no exaggeration to say that it is a dream-come-true paradise for adults and children. Universal Studios Singapore is located in Resorts World Sentosa, which cost SGD 7 billion (approximately NT 168.7 billion) to build. Travelers can take the Singapore MRT and get off at Harbourfront Station. After arriving at Vivo City, 01. Transfer to Sentosa Express: The fare is SD4 (about NT. 93), which can be paid with an Ez-link card. You can take it unlimited times without leaving Sentosa. It takes about 5 to 10 minutes and the operating hours are 07:00 to 24:00. You can take the Sentosa MRT on the 3rd floor (Lobby L) of VivoCity, and to Universal Studios, just take the Waterfront MRT Station. PS. If you are staying in Sentosa, you can exchange your free island entry ticket by showing your hotel check-in certificate to the light rail ticket counter staff. Take your ticket to the manual ticket checker and you can enter the island for free. The hotel will also give you a free ticket to enter the island, which means you can leave the island once and then enter Sentosa for free!",

Your online tickets will have RFQ code but at the gate they cannot read it, they will ask you to issue tickets from the ticketing office with BAR code. That would take up to 60min on a weekday if you are lucky. 1-Try to be there before 11am to avoid any delays. 2-Download the Universal Studios Singapore app to track which attraction has how many minutes of waiting time. 3-The attractions are all close to each other, so, dont worry about losing any chance to ride any of your favorite attractions. 4-I highly recommend that you tour the attractions a day before on YouTube to check what you like and what you dont. 5-Start with the ride you like which has 40min or less waiting time. You will be able to get there faster than 40min. 6-I did not see it worth to buy the faster access which is S90.00 additional to your adult ticket (which is S82.00)!. 7-All attractions are accessible from outdoor so in any case have rain coats and be prepared for a rainy day. 8-We were able to ride 7 out of 9 rides we planned to ride. 9-It is worth visiting and you can still have some more time to spend your evening somewhere else inside Sentosa island or back to the city. Finally, prepare a list of what you wish to do there and you will enjoy the experience. Thank you for reading so far.",

Every element of the park, from the exhilarating rides and stunning shows to the meticulously designed themed zones, is crafted to create an unforgettable experience. The staff is remarkably friendly and helpful, ensuring that your day is as smooth as possible. Be transported into various worlds, from Hollywood to Ancient Egypt, and let your imagination soar.

The fare on Kkdays is about NT2,000, and the express customs clearance is about NT2,000. The admission ticket and the express pass are purchased separately. The admission ticket also comes with an additional six yuan of Singapore dollars that can be used to purchase souvenirs or food and drinks in restaurants. It cannot be consumed at roadside stalls and specific areas. The Halloween event is from 7:30-00:30 in the evening, so you can arrive early to take photos. There was no queue for us to enter the park, we only had to queue to enter the facilities inside. In addition to five haunted houses, three horror experience areas, and two music performances at night, almost half of the amusement facilities are open for fun. The most exciting thing is the roller coaster. There are many kinds of roller coasters in the park with different ways to play. The difference between a haunted house and a horror experience area is the indoor haunted house and the outdoor haunted house. There are occasionally some staff dressed as ghosts or zombies on the roadside in the park, but they are very calm and will not chase them. The makeup is not particular, and they basically just wear masks and costumes. The style of haunted houses is much different from that of European and American haunted houses in the United States, Canada, etc. Maybe its because everyones physical and mental health needs to be taken into consideration? Although the event is not recommended for people under the age of 13, no children that young were seen participating. In short, this amusement park is suitable for first-time haunted house visitors.",

Starting from the accommodation at 10.00 Dunloop Street, walk towards Little India to take the MRT to Vivo City. Arriving at Vivo City we go straight to the bus stop, there is a special stop for Sentosa - HarbourFront Stn, about 30 minutes with views of the city across the bridge until we arrive at USS yeaaaaaa.. Alone on the USS? yup, explore on your own, (noted: you have previously ordered USS tickets on OTA, guys) so when you arrive at USS, take a photo first in front of the Universal Studios Singapore icon. Erm, because I was alone, I was brave enough to ask another tourist to take a photo, hehehe... armed with it, Hi miss, can you help me to take a picture here? Luckily they want to, or sometimes take photos instead. Wait, if you go to USS, your provider doesn't have a signal, don't worry. Because at USS there is public wifi that can be used. It's a good idea if you go to USS to download the Universal SG app, why? because with this application you can know the location of rides and waiting times in line. Very useful for those of us who want to try all the rides. Because I'm alone, I can really queue at Single Rider, a queue that complements the regular queue where they usually want to ride at the same time as friends or family, honestly this saves a lot of time. Yes, although not all rides can do it. Every certain time there is a show like that, you can check the app for the schedule, so we can take photos with several icons, come here Minnion tunes, transformers etc. There are several rides where it's best not to bring luggage (for example hats, glasses, cellphones) you can store them in a locker first, it's free within a certain time limit. You can try all the rides, the most impressive one is of course the Sci-Fi City ride on the Human Battlestar Galatica, I wanted to try the Cylon one but the queue was 80 minutes at that time, it was really long, The second ride that is a must try is in Ancient Egypt, you have to enter through a long corridor with a very mummy atmosphere, you get a really scary feel, riding a train in the dark. At the end there will be a photo of us taken while riding the ride, you can also ask for a print, hello. The third ride is at Lost World, Canopy Flyer and again it is great for single riders. Really like the Far Far Away location, the location is really beautiful.",

Attractions can be navigated better using a single rider. There are no attractions to take photos of, so there were quite a few young people who were enjoying themselves as single riders, even if they came in groups. In addition, I thought the prices of goods in the park were well, this is what it is'', but the food is expensive. Even if the portion size is the same, I felt that the prices were different depending on the location, such as restaurants, cafes, and outdoor stalls, so I think it's a good idea to walk a little bit to find what you want to eat.",

There were a lot of rides for younger children to ride and a lot of things to see. The ride itself was such a refreshing shock and fun. If I visit Singapore again, I think it will be because of this place. However, there were too many choices when purchasing tickets, so it was a bit annoying for someone like me.

They say they were sold out within 2 hours of opening. I think it's because it's the end-of-year season. There was also a VIP ticket that included an express and private guided tour, but it was about 400 per person, so I thought about it but decided against it. In the end, it was a good thing I didnt buy it! Because it was a rainy day, there were times when people flocked to certain attractions. If you download the Universal Map app (required) and watch the real-time waiting times (make sure to bookmark things to ride, see, and eat in advance), you will be able to enjoy the experience efficiently. Since a lot of children come here, if you get the timing right, you can ride without having to wait, and if you're not afraid of rain, you can ride even more comfortably haha. Attraction Recommendations & Recommendations - Siron is more fun than Human - I didn't like Shrek 4D... - Transformers 3D front row seat recommended - Highly recommend the Water World show! - Mummy Recommendation - Jurassic Park Rapids recommendation (everything is wet. Everything is wet.) - Spaghetti is completely for babies haha. Recommended if you like cute things. -The Indian restaurant was delicious. - Most souvenirs are available at the universal shop at the entrance, so there is no need to stop by each shop. Additionally, Sentosa Island has ziplines and luges, so it would be nice to spend a day enjoying them all. After getting wet and raining, it got cold as the sun went down, so I bought a Shrek blanket and covered myself with it. I think it would be a good idea to bring a raincoat, towel, and blanket if you can. You never know when it will rain in Singapore.",

Was surprised, as we went for transformers we were told there was some technical snag and ride was cancelled indefinitely for the day. Just as we were about to leave they started allowing people back again. Mummy ride should not be missed. Around 1.15 pm just as we were strolling the park the water world show was about to start. Luckily we were just near. I enjoyed the show. It's amazing to see their clean choreographed act. In between this decided to do the spaghetti sesame street ride. The queue was big but the ride was not worth it. Because its for small kids :P next we saw the Light camera action show by Steven Spielberg. It shows how a movie scene is made. It shows a cyclone hitting a city. Look out for the character greet and meet. They have specific timings. We saw Gru from indespicable me, Maurice from Madagascar, Sesame street characters. There was one dance show around the corner but we missed it twice [sigh] At last the two rides which will make u feel ur money worth The Galactica Cyclone and the Human. Did both one after another. Its gets your adrenaline rush instantaneously. There are lockers all around the rides which are free for use upto 20-45 min. There are plenty of restaurant options u can try. Worth visiting if u r in Singapore.",

If you want to buy inside, you can, but the price is 6 . For food, lots of choices. The price is pretty good in rupiah. But delicious.

The first impression was quite cool, as soon as we entered, all vehicles were directed to the bus parking which turned out to be in the basement. Go up the escalator, then you will meet the UNIVERSAL Globe Ball (everyone's favorite photo spot). Because we use a tour vendor, all USS ticket accommodation is facilitated, just check in at the gate. This is on a weekday, it's quite busy but comfortable enough for photos. The prices of food, snacks and other snacks here are quite expensive, in Singapore Dollars, prepare enough funds, master cards, QR payments, cash are also still accepted. There are lockers available to store luggage or other things if you want to enter the vehicle, provided that without any luggage, cellphones, coins, raincoats, shoe covers, even mountain shoes must be removed. If you don't want to queue, you can use an Express Card, there are several options for just 1 ride, or several rides but you can only play 1 time, or unlimited (the latter apparently can cost up to 200 Singapore Dollars). Don't forget for those who drink a lot, there are drinking water refill spots for tumblers or direct drinks. So all toilets, clean and comfortable. There are quite a lot of tables in the restaurant/cafe, there's still a chance of getting a table quickly, unless it's peak season, school holidays or something else. The price of food at the restaurant I went to was in the range of 20 - 40 Singapore Dollars, not including drinks. When I came in January, it rained all day starting at 1 pm, you had to prepare a rain coat, shoe cover and bag cover. It's comfortable going around the rides, and it turns out that what used to be a waiting list of 60-100 minutes in heavy rain conditions has become around 5 minutes!!! You should install the USS application in Playstore, so you can monitor updates on waiting times for each ride. Happy holiday.",

If I said it all it would be very long, so the remaining zone is The Lost World. Ancient Egypt in this zone is my favorite zone because it has Revenge of the Mummy.

To make the most of your time at Universal Studios Singapore, consider purchasing express passes to minimize wait times for popular rides.

I found the park more geared toward children, but adults can also have fun. The outdoor areas are a very interesting experience and reflect the country's history well. When I was there in February 2024, there was a construction site for a new attraction. I faced a few lines, and in one of them there was a technical stoppage with no forecast for the ride to return. I found this frustrating, because they were encouraging people to give up. I was at the front, and if I gave up, I would have to wait in line when the rides started working again. The right thing to do would be to clear the line and close the ride. The best thing to do is to download the Universal app, where you can favorite the rides you want to go on, and in the app you can track the queue time. The problem is that you can't follow the route in sequence, and you go back and forth to places when the queue is shorter. The best time to avoid waiting in line is at the end of the day. Then the queues are much shorter. Just pay attention to the shows, which have limited times. As for food, there are some options that aren't so cheap, but I didn't think they were exorbitantly priced. I went there and came back using a ride-hailing app to save time, but on the way back the drivers don't accept rides, and it's more expensive than the outward journey. The island and the area near the park are also very beautiful attractions. If you have time on your trip and are traveling with young people and children, it's a good experience. We stayed there until the park closed.",

The downside is that the price is too expensive. A small key ring costs 10 Singapore dollars each, so if you need a lot of souvenirs, we recommend bringing at least 100 Singapore dollars. The most expensive thing I saw was a snow globe with the Universal Studios logo costing 68 Singaipol. Shrek has a small Ferris wheel inside the store. (For children) It's quite disappointing that it ends at 6 o'clock, so I really recommend coming early and having an open run. For reference, there are a lot of shows in between. Going to Jurassic Park on that boat feels like a combination of a Whoop Ride and the Amazon Express. If you think 'I'll only get a little wet', you'll be wrong. You'll need a raincoat, and Daiso sells something that costs 1,000 won for 5 Singapore dollars, so the price difference is at least 5 times more. So, if you are going to ride, I recommend buying a raincoat in Korea.",

On weekends/public holiday there are too many people and big-big queues for any ride so my recommendation is going for express ticket else you wouldn't be able to have all the rides or see all the shows in 1 day. If you have normal ticket then it can take even 1 hour to be in queue and just cover 1 ride like transformer. Few rides might have shorter queue but again 30 min is minimum you have to wait for any ride. All the rides are worth going for and will provide you different experience. We could cover 3 rides and 2-3 shows overall in whole day and express ticket could have helped in covering all the rides. Though many rides are for adventurous people as they are either roller coaster or some other high speed rides and not everyone would love to do them so in that case normal tickets will be good enough. Transformer ride is a must go ride and will provide you a thrilling experience, it is a 3D ride and a unique experience, worth waiting for 1 hour in the queue for it. Stunt show was good and should be covered. Jurassic ride (Rapids Adventure I guess) is good but then at the end your clothes get wet so better to carry an additional pair or use rain coats (which is provided, might be at additional cost though). There are good food options inside though a bit costly but then you don't have any choice. You will get normal drinking water inside from taps. It was too hot so do carry sunglasses and caps. Overall a nice experience and recommended.",

We Adults & Kids definetly love this, sometimes we think, we need to go the ride again & again. Best attractions which we shouldn't miss is Roller coster, Jurassic park rapid adventure, Canopy flyer, Avengers, Transformers, Revenge of Mummy etc., My badluck during visit is Revenge of Mummy is closed for maintenance. Every attractions is excellent. Better to start early in the day, make sure that we reach there by 9:30 am. Better to take MRT & bus to reach here. If we want to avoid waiting in queue, need to buy VIP pass, which costs more. For many attractions, the photography / video is not allowed. For some rides like jurassic park rapid adventure, bags are not allowed to take as there are high chances of getting wet. Few of them carry / purchase the rain covers to protect them from water. People who come early, first visit the attractions like Transformers, Avengers, Mummy etc., so there will be huge queue in front. If we want to avoid queue, better to come from last, so that we can avoid queues. Visit these attactions post the lunch, so that it will be empty. Food: - Food is costly here, we can carry some snacks / food to save money. Photo package: - People try to come and ask you to take photo package with unlimited photograph. If we take the package, sometimes the server will not work and finally we will end up of getting multiple tags. Consolidating photos from multiple tags will be tedious. Meet & Greet We can meet lot of characters like minions and few others and take photos. There are people who help to take photos with this characters using our phone. They take lot of photos too, so no worries. Though the ticket is costly, but it is worth to spend to enjoy. Make sure spending entire day till 5-6 pm, so that we dont miss any attractions.",

It is a theme based park with full of attractions and activities that you will love and enjoy. It is better to enter the park at the opening time so you can experience almost all the rides there. Its better to take the tickets in advance and can avoid the long queue especially in the weekends. The fast track tickets are available, it will help to skip the long queue in rides. But we have to pay double the cost for normal, I think it worths. Otherwise it will take two or three days to complete experiencing all rides and activities. Never miss the roller coaster rides. In rainy weather they will stop most of the rides including roller coaster. Mobile phones are strictly not allowed in roller coaster. And they close at 6.00pm, its a very short time period for this mega adventure park. I strongly suggest to the management of Universal Studios to extend the time for closing to at least up to 07.30 pm. Anyway the time spend in this place is amazing, kids are really enjoying it. Dont miss it when you come to visit Singapore.",

For popular rides like Mummy Returns, Transformers, and Jurassic Rapid Adventure, it's better to wait until about noon to avoid long queues. Be prepared with a raincoat if you don't want to get soaked, although they do provide drying machines. An umbrella is also a good idea. It's definitely a fantastic place to visit with family and friends, especially kids. I'm excited for the new Minion attraction and Super Mario World area to open!",

Their attentiveness and courteous service. I'm tour Manager from Guideline Travels and my guests are Jain vegetarian. I have catered food for them, as they can't consume vegetables such as potatoes, garlic, and onion. I didn't know there's no re-entry for Universal Studio Singapore. I spoke to Mr. Lynne to allow my guests for a re-entry once they have consumed their food, and they will enter back to Universal Studio Singapore. Lynne was of great help to allow my guests to be re-entry. I would also like to greatly appreciate the assistance of Ms. Rosemary and Mr. Karthik in ensuring that the guests are given a re-entry stamp. Their willingness to accommodate as my guests are Jain vegetarian undoubtedly enhance the experience for all attendees. Now, knowing there is no re-entry, my next visit, I will inform my Travels not to cater food for our guests. Thank you once again for the excellent service and attention to detail.",

The monorail has two cars, so it tends to get crowded. Tickets are available from vending machines and on weekdays, you can buy tickets right away with your credit card without having to wait in line. I've been to Universal Studios in Japan, and compared to that, the 1-day pass price seemed a little cheaper, although it depends on the exchange rate. It was a shame that the first part of the attraction was closed or suspended due to renovations. Although there were some characters I didn't know, I enjoyed it, and since the grounds are compact, I was able to visit all the attractions in one day.

If you don't have an express ticket, you have to go at 9 o'clock, otherwise you really need an express ticket. Admission tickets are around 80,000 won express tickets are around 90,000 won... It's really expensive. No matter how hot it is, people explode. It's nice that there are facilities so you can wait in the shade even if the waiting line is long, but the standard waiting time is over 50 minutes. If you don't have an express ticket, raise your hand quickly and use it when a single ride seat becomes empty. I didn't know what it was, but found out later. There is a locker at the entrance for about 12 for 4 hours. Payment is made by card, but Amex cards rarely work in Singapore. Go inside and there is a storage box near Egypt(?), but there are a lot of people, so let's leave it at the entrance. There aren't many places to buy souvenirs or drinks. It's crowded near the entrance, and the further you go inside, the more rides there are. It is not sold everywhere like Everland. If you see a place selling something, I recommend buying it right away. When entering a restaurant, the group will take a seat and one person will go to order food.",

If you enjoy movie-themed rides, roller coasters, cartoon mascots, and all things silly and wonderful, this is the place for you! You cannot see everything in one day, so try to arrive as early as possible. However, here are a few tips: 1. Get an Express Pass or you will spend the majority of the day lining up for rides. Typical tickets require you to wait for 30-60 minutes or more, which is extremely frustrating! 2. I recommend bringing a personal fan and water with you. The humidity can make you tired quickly. Water is not cheap either! 3. Eat before you leave... So you have energy, and you will not have to spend as much money on food while you are there. Unless, of course, you are also there for the food.",

Food and juices are available inside. Roller coasters have most wait times. Prayer room is also available. There can be combos offered but I think only separate dedicated trip is recommended. To reach monorail from Vivo center is most convenient way which cost 4/5 Singapore dollar. Transformers was acclaimed to be worth watching in 4d etc but after few days I found 6d experience at genting Highland which was far better. However in rides, universal studios is far superior to genting Highland. Overall it's a wonderful experience and also costly but it's only once a while and worth it.",

Nestled within the Resorts World Sentosa, this theme park offers an impressive array of attractions, shows, and dining options that cater to visitors of all ages. As soon as I entered the park, I was struck by the vibrant atmosphere and the detailed theming of each zone. From the futuristic landscapes of Sci-Fi City to the enchanting streets of Far Far Away, every area is beautifully designed and immersive. The iconic Hollywood Boulevard sets the stage perfectly with its charming shops and street performances. One of the highlights of my visit was the rides. The **Transformers: The Ride** was a standout, combining cutting-edge technology with thrilling action that left me breathless. The **Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure** was another favorite, offering both excitement and a chance to cool off from the Singapore heat. For those seeking a more family-friendly experience, the **Shrek 4-D Adventure** was delightful, filled with humor and engaging visuals. The live shows were equally impressive. The **WaterWorld** stunt show was a thrilling spectacle with jaw-dropping stunts and pyrotechnics that captivated the audience. Its a must-see for anyone visiting the park! Dining options are plentiful, with various cuisines available. I enjoyed a delicious meal at Mel's Drive-In, which offered classic American fare in a retro setting. While the food was tasty, prices were a bit on the higher side, which is typical for theme parks. One thing to keep in mind is that the park can get quite crowded, especially on weekends and holidays. I recommend arriving early and considering an Express Pass to make the most of your day without long wait times. Overall, Universal Studios Singapore is a fantastic destination filled with fun, adventure, and unforgettable experiences. Whether youre a thrill-seeker or just looking to enjoy a day of entertainment, its a great choice. I left with wonderful memories and cant wait to return! Highly recommended for families and friends alike.",

Its the first Universal Studios theme park in Southeast Asia and having seven themed zones, including Hollywood, New York, and Jurassic Park, each immersing visitors into the magic of cinema. When I visited about a year ago, I had an incredible time exploring the park. The highlight for me was definitely the extreme rides like the Battlestar Galactica rollercoaster and the Transformers 3D experience. The live shows, such as the Water world stunt show, were also fantastic, providing some great moments of excitement and humour. I really appreciated the immersive theming in each zone, and the parks attention to detail in food and merchandise added an extra layer of enjoyment. However, one downside I noticed was that the park can get quite crowded, especially during the weekend and the prices there for food and drinks is quite expensive, like a single water bottle there cost 4 Singaporean Dollar but the food was nice though like the churros i got. Wait times for some of the popular rides were longer than expected, and the park felt a bit cramped in certain areas. While the attractions are great, a few could use some updates or new features to keep things even more cool :). Despite these drawbacks, if you enjoy theme parks and can visit during weekday, I would definitely recommend Universal Studios Singapore. It offers a fun day out for families and friends, but be prepared for the weekend crowds if youre planning to go during at that time.",

We entered the park at 10 o'clock, bought Klook Christmas ticket (including main course and drinks, but there are only a few very limited meals to choose from, so it is not recommended if you have special dietary needs), basically there was no facility that required a queue of more than half an hour all day, and the souvenir shop felt like it sold things mixed together. We walked around all the places and watched every show at around 5 o'clock. The Mummy is awesome, I think both adults and children will like it; I personally really like the atmosphere and spaghetti situation of Far Far Land; Shrek's show and Stroll's show are also very attentive If you only plan to stay in Sentosa for one day, you can leave Universal Studios early and go somewhere else!",

I bought tickets on the website, it was about PLN 500 for two tickets for one day. In the park you can watch Water World live, it's another must-see in this park. You can find a large gastronomic offer, there is a Starbucks where we went to cool off and have a drink, because it was terribly hot. I recommend visiting the Universal Studio store, you can find great souvenirs there, I bought a magnet there for 10 Singapore. The prices are high but it's like in all such places. In general, I highly recommend visiting this place, but you need at least 2 days to visit everything calmly.

I recommend getting a fast pass. You'll wait much less time at activities. Especially children get bored while waiting. Fast pass provides an advantage. Rollercosters are a lot of fun. The adrenaline level of the black one is very high. We went in the afternoon. The fast pass was sufficient for all activities from 2 o'clock until closing. If you want to travel comfortably, relax and do the activities we love over and over again, go in the morning. Otherwise, 6 hours is enough for everything.

The day I went was a weekday and it was raining lightly, but there were some stops. Some sunshine is considered very lucky. That's not hot at all. If it rains, choose to play in the shade. Or sit and watch a show When the sun came out, I took pictures of the beautiful light. Playing on outdoor playground equipment, very fun, very chill. You can bring food in. Because I was able to bring in snacks such as croissants, juice, fruit, and candy without being inspected much. As for water, if it feels heavy, you don't have to put it in. Because everywhere you go to play There will be free tap water to drink. There are lockers where you can leave your things for free for 45 minutes (some lockers are not free. You have to choose carefully) because some rides don't allow you to bring things in with you. Even the coins",

Use the MRT to get to UNIVA, and Singapore has a well-developed transportation network that is easy to understand, convenient, and fast. And you can go there safely and securely. And everyone is kind. After arriving at Univa, I was able to easily go around the attractions in about 2 hours and ride the attractions without waiting. Being in a subtropical region, I was physically exhausted from all the hard walking, so I decided to return home after about 3 hours. It's disappointing and expensive compared to Universal in Japan, but it was a great memory of my trip.",

For those who have big guts and are not afraid of sliding at high speed, it is recommended to try the Transformer, Roller Coaster and the Mummy. Shouting, screaming and crying of any kind is not prohibited. Suitable for those who have just broken up. There is also a Jurassic park. It's best to bring your own disposable raincoat. If you buy it here the price is 6 dollars. Lockers here are paid. Don't forget to bring an umbrella and hat. To get to Sentosa Island, you can take the tram (30 Sing Dollars) from Vivo station. You can also take the bus. If you can stand the heat, you can walk. There are also quite a lot of food sellers. The types of food sold are also varied with varying prices. If you want to buy souvenirs, there are lots of shops too. The price is 11-12 with prices in Indonesian tourist attractions.

Since Disneyland and Universal Studio are located in certain countries, if you like theme parks, I think you should definitely visit them if they are available in the country you are visiting. I definitely recommend you come on weekdays and early in the morning. I arrived at 10 o'clock in the morning and first rode the Transformers ride, and although it was one of the most popular toys here, I did not wait in line at all, but after an hour, all the toys were full and the queues started to pile up. That's why I recommend you come as early as possible in the morning and ride the most popular rides before people get crowded. Also, the fast pass is just an added feature after purchasing the normal ticket. Do not buy it from the internet by mistake, otherwise you will have to buy an entry ticket again. I think if you are coming on a weekday, you do not need to buy a fast ticket, you can ride all of them with a little wait. There is no need to buy tickets online because the capacity of these parks is 50,000 people. I have never seen the tickets run out. You can buy them at the door with cash or card option. I recommend Transformers, Ancient Egypt, Human, and Jurassic Park, but ride knowing that in Jurassic Park you get quite wet, including your shoes. Water World was closed when I went, but it was among the must-visit places. The standard entrance ticket was 83 Singapore dollars, the price of adding the express pass was more expensive than the ticket. Also, if you follow the hours, Shrek and Minions characters greet each other and take photos. It is a very enjoyable and beautiful moment. I definitely recommend it. It is done many times a day.",

One larger than the other kinds. 3] There are rides like Transformers which are kind of virtual roller coaster rides and it is one of the top most attraction apart from roller coaster. 4] There are many rides like Puss in the boots which are for smaller kids 5] They also have 2-3 shows which are basically live and are arranged for only twice a day and run for 45 mins in each run. Please check the timings of the show as soon as you enter to enjoy them throughly. We had seen a show of Waterworld where they performed a lot of live stunts which was amazing to see. 6] Food options are relatively limited. If you are vegetarian they are only one or two options like Biryani inside. But it is not a big problem as such. 7] There are too many things to see so make sure that you reach there on time. 8] Please check that tickets are in order. I had booked a 3 day pass through Klook or similar site and it turnout that I had to mail them Universal first and then they send the tickets. This process wasted half an hour for me.

There are plenty of food options too- from quick snacks and drinks to proper meals at theme styled restaurants.

You can get a 10% discount on all purchases within the park with your MasterCard, but be aware that some stores do not accept credit cards. My recommendation is the drink cup. If you carry it with you, you can get an additional drink for 3. It's a sturdy cup, so you can use it at home as wellIf you have an E-ticket, don't forget to print it out using the printer on the right side of the park entrance.",

You should make the decision to purchase the EXPRESS like we did.. It's no joke, if you're planning to come here with family with kids.. With anyone.. Be prepared to spend a minimum of 100 to 50 per person.. The price for express changes based one the demand for it.. So the earliest bird gets the cheaper but on weekends its pretty standard at 100. Why do you need to spend that amount.. Let me tell you why... If you do not want to que at every ride... Carrying kids in the sun.. While trying to finish as many.. Please buy it. We did not que at any except for one ride.. Which didn't have express... While we got express I saw parents with kids... Crying, restless.. Just waiting for literally hours.. No joke.. They waited for 2 hours for one ride.. And rides that lasted you less than 5 to 8 mins.. Can you imagine.. If you wanted to go again.. You had to line another hour or so.. Or longer.. There are two types of express.. 1 limited to just one time per ride.. And unlimited... As many times.. We got the unlimited but if its your first time that's alright.. If you think you only wanted to do everything once. Its preferences. I went for one ride 4 times as I saw the same people in line. As a couple we finished every ride.. Took us 6 hours... I guess even longer with kids.. And also.. We went to nearly ever show.. Get the map and the showtime pamphlet.. And be ready for all.. You wouldn't want to miss it.",

However, one tip(?): I don't know if it was the day I went that was the problem, but the equipment often broke down. I had to wait a long time because the Transformer was broken and the Human was also broken. If an announcement is made that there is a delay because the Transformer is broken, don't wait and get on the other one first. It will be resolved quickly haha. I don't think it's as quick as in our country. And since it's hot, I recommend visiting on a cloudy day haha. 1. Express 2. Dont wait for breakdowns 3. Prepare for the heat.",

If you are single or willing to split up on rides, you can finish it early. They should allow this option on all the rides. Lots of photo ops everywhere. Kids will definitely enjoy. For adults there are fewer exciting rides, with lots of waiting. They don't allow photography on any ride for safety. That's good. But with appropriate mount for action cams they should.",

The other one is the Madagascar story, luckly it does not get you wet. The Enchanted Airways dollar coaster is great for first time roller coaster riders. It is fast and and scary for starters. We also have the Human and Cyclone roller coasters in Sci-fi City. They are for professional riders. The Puss in boots ride is fun too also for starters, Many like the Revenge of the Mummy, scary, fun and fast all at the same time! This my favourite. There is also many moving about like VR, one of them is a show, and 2 others are rides. Again, get the Express pass lines can get up to 1 hour. The service of the staff at the ticket booth the first time I came here were quite nice. I can say the atmosphere of this place is nice. But the food there not that good. There are many shops here and there. So far just bring a hat and umbrella as weather in Singapore is unpredictable.

One of the most beautiful entertainment experiences. It has everything you want. But my advice is to take the VIP ticket. It is better for you because it is crowded and this makes you enter the game before anyone else and enjoy your time. Try the Death Train or the Express Train. Also, the car game is a beautiful experience that makes you come back to try it and enjoy it and yourself will come back to try it. The most important thing is that the ticket is in the highest category so that you can enjoy others, as you will get tired of waiting Because it is sometimes crowded as you can imagine",

The passes are valid for a few days since time of booking. So you can get them in advance. Each ride has a counter at the entrance telling you the waiting period for the same. Start your day early in the morning so you have less waiting period for each ride. Eateries inside have mainly non vegetarian food. But right near the Transformers, there is a STAR-BOT Cafe....you will get 100% vegetarian food there. And huge bowls of it. Trust me, you won't leave disappointed. Roadside hawkers are also located every few blocks. Big rides like Battlestar Gallactica will take easily about 1hour to await your turn. Plan your day accordingly. Water rides are also amazing and must do.",

Sometimes the general channel queues for 2 hours, single people only need to queue for 15 minutes. You can put it before playing mummy and red and blue roller coaster Bags are stored in the lockers, which is very convenient! There are free storage hours, and you will be charged if you exceed the time limit (so remember to bring some cash with you) Try not to bring anything with you when you are waiting for the roller coaster, including your mobile phone! Dont bring it! It will fall off the staff will check it for you before queuing up Recommended food in the park: turkey legs (really huge). The gourmet restaurants in the park are all the same, it depends on what style you want to eat. There is a restaurant in Lost World with a giraffe outside. The fried stick legs inside are OK! If you dont like the restaurants in the park, you can go to the exit to get a park stamp, and then come back in to play after youve eaten enough! Recommended parent-child itinerary: No1-Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Station No2-4D Shrek No3-Madagascar No.4-Jurassic River Adventure No5-The Adventures of the Invincible Cat Swordsman No6-Charizard Flight School After leaving the gate, go right to the seawall steps, facing vivo city. There is a 15-minute free crane ballet water dance show at 8:00 every night. You can watch it! Very exciting The light rail express on Vivo city 3F only charges once when you go there.

We queued for our first ride: Transformer. 30 mins into the queue, the ride broke down (We encounter power failure while in the queue). Turn out a few rides were affected (Transformer, the Mummy, Jurassic Park rapid adventure and Madagascar crate adventure). So the crowd dispersed and concentrate on other rides making the the queue to balloon to 60 mins or more. Due to covid19, most rides have their capacities reduced by half (they kept alternate row empty for social distancing). Again, this contribute to the longer queue. On hindsight, the best decision I made today: I purchased unlimited express pass for myself and my 2 kids. Instead of queuing for 60 mins, I get to ride 3 different rides in 1 hour. Some rides, I get to ride multiple times. Those downed rides went back up after 2 hours or so (Transformer went down again later in the evening). I noticed the crowds were getting lesser after 6pm. Most likely because most people went for dinner or went home. This is the best timing for getting on rides if you dont have express pass. The rides are open from 2pm to 9pm. I would have rated my experience 2 stars without the unlimited express pass. It seriously worth the splurge.",

Thereafter we decided to purchase the Express Pass which is priced almost the same as the entry ticket. With the Express tickets, the longest wait is about 20 mins, and the fastest was no queue required for the Express lane at Transformer 4D.

Definitely worth it as we were able to cover more attractions. F&B: Most restaurants and cafes were open with only a few closed. There are at least 2-3 Halal restaurants open during this period. Facilities: Free lockers available to store personal items during the ride. Musollah for Muslim guests is closed during this period, thus remember to bring your own prayer mats. Overall, experience was great and crowd was on par during pre Covid days. Social Distancing Ambassadors are around to advise guests and can be seen almost everywhere.

Go for transformers first if you dont have roller coaster experience. It will be definitely awesome. Then revenge of the mummy is indoor coaster in dark chill environment. Other than coaster thrill nothing much actually. Battlestar galactica coasters both will give you an experience that you wont forget for life. Both humans and cylons equally great. Human coaster is fast and more gravity drops than cylons. Cylons are more about inversion, but its not that scary coz speed cancels out the gravity. So dont miss that too. Express pass recommended if you dont want to wait. I went on a weekend and I didnt wait in queue for any rides. Express line is virtually empty. Queue length and wait time is huge in normal line. Try to reach 30 mins earlier before park rides opens. You will be allowed inside. Can stroll around and get to know the park before starting. 4 star coz some of the rides and shows are cancelled.",

It was a bit costly but well worth it. We got included souvenirs, dining credits, and Express Unlimited cards for after the tour. The best part we had a guide take us around the park wherever we wanted to go and he took us too all the rides up from the exits. We went straight in, zero waiting, ahead of the lines including the Express line. This was great. We could pick the front row or wherever we wanted. We could do multiple times, etc. Some lines had an 80 minute wait. We had none. Again expensive but worth it. Additionally our guide scheduled photo opportunity with Transformers and we were first in line and no wait for Megatron. Funny as a decepticon he was complaining to us the whole time. Good fun. All in all it was hot and humid but moving quickly through the park was super helpful and nice.",

Always purchase Express Pass. It will save your time, especially in the weekend. 2. Sentosa Train now is free. I don't know for how long, but now even you have to tap your EZLink card, the price is 0 SGD. 3. Go in early, get out late. Maximize your time. 4. Always purchase the souvenirs for at least at 5 pm (2 hours before closing). There will be a long queue if you go at closing time. You cannot freely choose to buy anything. 5. Buy at the Universal Souvenir Shop (next to HelloKitty Store). It is the only place that contains all of the characters. 6. Take photo in the Alley next to the Mel's Restaurant. It have a lot of unique photo spots. Also check when the lights goes on. You will have a bit different ambience of the photos. 7. There will be some closed/under renovations Attractions. If you purchase the standart Express pass, you will be eligible to ride the same attractions more than 1 time if you choose.",

The price is about 70,000 won per day for adults. Approximately 50,000 won for children It's not cheap at all. Express Pass tickets cost 20,000 to 30,000 won on top of the basic price. The line is quite fast. The scale felt the same or smaller than Lotte World. Because it is a franchise, the prices are quite expensive. If you don't go there just to ride the rides, people who like taking pictures or who like the universal world view will likely enjoy it. Even though it was a weekday, there were a lot of people. Depending on popularity without Express Pass, the wait can be as short as 30 minutes or as long as 2 hours. I was the worst because I didn't like waiting in line. The restaurants in the theme park are packed with people trying to order, and the prices are much higher than Singapore prices, so I recommend eating a good meal before entering the USS. For simple food and beverages sold at stands, the waiting line is long and stock runs out early. There is a card reader, but is it broken? There are many places that only accept cash. In conclusion, I think visiting once is enough.",

Otherwise, in Singapores weather, you will have to queue for several hours for each item and then the game will end in 1 to 3 minutes. There is really no experience at all. Although priority tickets are expensive, without priority tickets, it is almost impossible to experience most of Universal Studios' projects in one day, especially on weekends and holidays. Relatively speaking, the two types of priority tickets can only be used once for all items (except for a few). The unlimited priority tickets are not necessary unless you particularly love one of the items. The Battlestar Coaster is definitely the flagship of all the roller coaster projects at Universal Studios. If there are no health risks, this project is 100% recommended to experience. Of course, this project is also one of the projects with the largest queues (there is also a project with a large number of people queuing for Jurassic World Ride, which I personally think is very average). There is a sister roller coaster next to this roller coaster (red track), which has a lower difficulty level (no 360-degree rotation). Friends who want to ride a roller coaster but are afraid of it can experience this roller coaster first, and then consider whether to go to the Ace Coaster for fun. There is the only Starbucks not far from the entrance of the park. The other restaurants in the park can only be said to be quite satisfactory. The taste and price are not far different from those outside the scenic area. At least it is enough to satisfy your appetite. Compared with the catering in a certain country's scenic area, it is simply too conscientious. Compared with Universal Studios in other countries, the projects are single and the area is much smaller. It is also unbelievable that some products, including the parks sales stores, are out of stock. However, Universal Studios Singapore is still highly recommended as one of the must-see attractions when traveling to New Zealand. Finally, I reiterate that priority tickets are really worth buying if you want to really play. Finally, I wish you (we) have fun!",

You have to wait in very very long queue. For normal transformer ride i have to wait for 2 hours in queue. In 6 hours i only get 2 rides due to long queue. Only buy express ticket. It will cost you double price then regular ticket. Suggestions for universal studios - you should only provide one ticket. Increase the price of tickets as much as you want. If person buys ticket he should get benifit of ticket. Standing in queue for 2 hours for 1 ride is very big disappointment",

So prices will increase as demand increases or as the park gets busier. There are two types of express pass. One is for unlimited rides (90) and the other is express pass for one ride each (60), ie ie you can only fast pass each ride once. A wrist band is issued for unlimited rides and a ticket is issued for \"single\" express pass where the rides are ticked off when used. Our group picked the single fast pass and then was told four of the fast pass rides were closed so we were able to \"replace\" those with other rides that we liked. We got in just after 12, left at closing and struggled to go on all the rides. Can't imagine the productivity if there was no express pass when queues are 1-2 hours long. Free lockers are provided for some of the roller-coaster which means waiting can seem longer without a phone. Overall a great day out.",

We didn't print the pass just had on our phone, which was a mistake because when we came into the park we saw no info on how to get wrist bands, and I am pretty sure they charge you extra for them. Our friends who printed the passes just had them ticked off on the paper ticket as they did the rides, you could always print multiple copies if you wanted to ride them again so stupid system. Ours were scanned and we got a stamp on our wrists, which sweated off right away... I think they need to rethink the fast passes.",

We pre booked the tickets in advance to avoid any delays in the queue and we were glad we did. It saved us quite some time. As soon as we enter, the whole atmosphere changes. It is recommended to buy Universal express pass to avoid the hour long queues for each and every theme ride. There are 2 types of passes one is of 60 and another is of 90. The first pass allows a person take each ride only once but the later allows unlimited rides which I regret that I didnt take. Each and every ride is awesome and gives wonderful experience. Among those rides Transformers theme and Mummy theme rides will give you goosebumps. We have locker services provided before we get on few rides so we dont loose our stuff during the ride. Overall it was a wonderful experience to have.",

Ticket prices are premium so even if taken from any sites like Klook etc would not make any difference. For Indians, ticket prices from Klook, with admission express, will be around 9,500 per person which as per Singapore standards is reasonable. Plan to buy tickets in advance. The queues at the spot are very long. Arrive 20 minutes before the starting time and skip long entry queues by showing your express pass at the entry counter. Try to complete either Jurassic ride or Mummy returns first. There will be no queue when the park opens. Later even the express queues get long and would be at least 30 mins of waiting. There are a few rides like Treasure Hunt (Ancient Egypt) and Jurassic Canopy rides that don't have express entrance but are in demand. If you are with a kid, you may want to spend some time during peak afternoon time at Far Far Away land and see some of the shows. Remember to carry Umbrellas and Sunglasses. By 4 30 pm, the queues we saw were less in Express and hence could visit Transformers ride almost with no queue in express. Overall, an okay experience. Nothing great if you have visited the LA Universal Studio. SG Universal Studio is a smaller, compact entertainment park. We didn't see any angry crew. In fact, all the staff were very friendly and helped in answering queries on directions. Tips 1. Do not visit without the Express Pass 2. Carry Sunglasses, umbrellas 3. Jurassic ride you will get wet. 4. Canopy rides in Jurassic, Puss n Boots, enhancement airways can be a bit scary for kids , but is okay for adults. 5. Mummy returns is a must scary ride 6. All rides are about 1 min max 7. Lights Action Camera, New York ride, Shrek 4D are okay for small kids too. 8. Staff are friendly. Ps: photo shows the rush for Mummy returns in the express lane. About 30 mins waiting at around 1 pm.",

It is highly recommended to buy the express ticket. Although it is almost double the price, it is really worth it. We didnt wait more than 10 mins in any of the lines on a saturday. They have the same universal studios quality in this park as well. One of the best place to spend some time in Sentosa island.",

From heart-pounding roller coasters to immersive 3D shows, there's something for everyone. However, on regular admission, be prepared for potentially long wait times, which might limit your ability to enjoy all the attractions. To maximize your visit, consider investing in an express ticket, which allows you to bypass the queues and make the most of your day. The park's attention to detail in creating themed zones is commendable, offering visitors an immersive experience. Additionally, the staff are generally friendly and helpful, enhancing the overall experience. Dining options are varied and cater to different tastes, though they can be a bit pricey. Overall, Universal Studios Singapore is a must-visit for fans of theme parks and movie enthusiasts, but be sure to plan ahead to make the most of your visit.",

You should keep your belongings in a locker before the ride. Locker will be provided free for the first 90 minutes. After that 20 minute rate slots will be applicable. Heart patients/ pregnant mothers should not access this ride. Believe me I thought I died during the ride Better you have food/ refreshments from outside if you are in a tight tour budget. There are different show times for each zone. You can meet the characters and take photographs at each zone. Mainly right infront of Minions store. They have provided photography service at each zone where you can get it printed in a frame (charges applicable). Minions park will be opened in 2024.",

                "review_text": "1- Prices have become expensive compared to before, and there is also renovation work that may end in 2025. I bought a fast track bracelet for my family for all the games and I was surprised that there are games that do not include fast track. In one of the games I asked an employee on the fast track because the track board was not clear, unfortunately. He put me in a queue where I sat for an hour, and it turned out that the employee had racial fanaticism and deliberately put me in the wrong lane and did not put me in the express entry lane. There is poor regulation of express entry, meaning that There is a card that you buy to enter some games, fast entry, and this is the reason for its crowding and the lack of clarity about those who have the fast entry bracelet from the card. There is chaos, some of them enter the fast lane without having a card or bracelet, and they enter the game without any supervision from the organizers. 2- I also bought an express entry card for offers, although it was previously part of the express entry bracelet, but they separated it. Unfortunately, its price was very expensive, and entry was poorly organized because they were sorting people outside, but inside the hall the situation was chaotic. You would find everyone sitting in the express entry area, so I absolutely do not recommend buying it. Come ten minutes before the show and after you enter because there are no organizers inside, sit in the front where those who have... Express entry cards. 3- Previously, the studio opened at 10 p.m. and closed at 7 p.m., meaning (9 hours) and at an acceptable price, but now it opens at 11 a.m. and closes at 6 p.m., meaning (7 hours), at a high price, and a third of the studios games are closed. 4- It was a very bad experience and I was disappointed in Universal Studio due to the chaos, the negligence of the organizers inside, the restoration work, and the high prices. I do not advise anyone to visit it due to the presence of restoration work, as well as the presence of restoration work on Sentosa Island, and many of the events that were free on the island have become expensive and have become Concern is money, not tourist entertainment.",

The entertainments vary from the highest adrenaline-seeking to your family-friendly comedy shows. Pictures! Pictures could be taken anywhere especially with the merchandises that you could buy there. Now, on to the critiques and advices. Of course, every place has its flaws and these reviews are here to help build it for the better First of all, the queues. The queues will take you 15-60 minutes for only about 5 minutes of entertainment. That's why I would HIGHLY recommend getting the express ticket. You could upgrade your regular ticket to an express in the ticket booth up front. It is pricy at first sight, but the amount of rides you could experience and the amount of time you save is worth it. But note that not all rides accept express in the way that you need to wait as of the others. I would recommend bringing a change of clothes as it would often get hot, you'd get wet while riding a ride. In my case, I forgot to bring an extra change, so I had to buy one _. Last but not least, bring your family, friends, wife or husband, relatives, and so on. They will make the trip even better. That is all. Enjoy uss",

Ensure you visit on a weekday, like Thursday and be right on time before the opening time, and the trick is to avoid entering the rides near the entrance first. Start with those in the back or the ones with high demand, such as the Transformers ride. In the evening, the rides near the entrance are always empty, so that's the perfect time to go there. Use the Universal Studios app to check wait times and navigate accordingly, rather than following a set order. Mark down the meet and greet times and spots to arrive right on time. The roller coasters are worth it, and lockers are free for a duration of around 30-40 minutes. We checked roller coaster wait times, selected lockers, finished the ride, switched lockers, and went to the next ride, so we didn't pay for lockers at all. If you still lack time you can skip the enchanted airways and magic potion spin which looks less exciting after riding the main roller coaster rides. Yes, the food and drinks are expensive, but having a big breakfast outside and the motivation to try all the rides meant we barely felt hungry, so we didn't dine there at all. You can take water inside, so no need to buy their overpriced water and drinks. All the rides and shows were excellent, providing a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Buy the tickets online in a site like Klook which is cheaper.",

If you have Express, it is enough for 4 hours to play all the games. In games that require you to put your things inside the locker, it is free for 90 minutes or 40 depending on the game. There are water shows and others that do not have fees. You can find out the show times from their application Halal food is everywhere you know, from a sticker on the door or near the cashier, and dont forget to try the delicious Shrek waffle. Avoid the weekend crowds. You can take pictures of any cartoon character and the organizers will help you. Most train games are considered fun, except for one that is considered dangerous called Battlestar Galactica 1- Train: Transformers ride (suitable for children) 2-Train: The Mummy 3- Train: Jurassic park 4- Train: puss in boots (fun for children and adults) If you fear 1-3-4 or 2 is fun and fast, download the map and enjoy your day",

Comment: I noticed that the game instructors had to introduce the game with a microphone over and over again throughout the day. In the last game, I saw that the player couldn't speak and his voice was hoarse. If these introductions were recorded, they could observe and help the players when needed.

On Mummy's Ride, it says that you have to put your personal belongings in a coin locker (if you wait 15 minutes, 45 minutes are free), but since the waiting time was much longer than the displayed wait time, we ended up having to pay. What do you do when your wallet is in the coin locker? ? ? It was very crowded and I had to call a staff member to open the paid lockers, which surprised me at how inefficient it was. The guidebook said it was cashless only, but there were some places that didn't accept Amex, so I ended up paying in cash. At restaurants, there are too many people occupying tables and taking breaks without eating, resulting in unnecessary waiting time. It was the worst dining experience because the cast members were unmotivated and didn't pay attention or consideration. If you don't have an express pass, you'll have to wait in line for the attractions, but I don't think it's necessary to buy a pass. For families with children, it can be quite tiring not to have easy rides where you can ride without waiting.",

Usually when we visit USS, it is also a staycation in RWS, and so we will usually exit during lunch time, maybe go back to the room to rest and escape from the afternoon sun and come back again after 3pm. No re-entry means lunch was inside USS. As it is the school holidays, the place is quite crowded and due to the rain, everyone was indoors. As a gauge, a burger and fries set is 17 and a corn dog is 7, and a scope of ice cream is 7. 2. Universal express pass is limited. If you do not wish to wait in queue for rides (as a gauge, Rapid dash was 50 mins queue, transformer ride was 60 mins and Puss-in-boots ride was 40 mins wait), the express pass is an option. It cost about 90 for a person, but from the beginning of the year, they no longer offer unlimited express pass. The express pass can only be used once at every attraction. For example if you are not intending to use the pass for the enchanted airways ride, it cannot be used for a 2nd express ride for transformer ride. With minion land still under construction, Dino soarin also not available, there were less rides available, we were hoping that we can do a few more rounds with other rides. The forum area at RWS is under renovation and many food options closed due to new development in RWS, perhaps it will be better to come again when all the development is done.",

Foodcourt outside Jurassic Park has really good food options ! 6. No waiting time for park entry, queue is needed for activities . Street performance was fun and gave good vibes.

The park puts a lot of focus on sesame Street, which i found very different, but in a good way. The park runs a wonderful scam called express pass. They really market the product well BUT out of the couple dozen rides at the park available to ride, the express pass provides redeamable express opportunity for approximately 6 or so rides and the price is disgustingly high. A little known fact is that universal singapore is the only universal franchise in the globe. The Singapore universal studios are owned by a private company called resorts world sentosa. This is reflected in the crazy bits and pieces you come across throughout your day - example:, no drink lids available for your drinks, no salt in the food outlets accessible to patrons, no paper copy express passes etc i could go on, however it just reflects and highlights the cost cutting going on, by the private company, at the expense of the customer experience. This in turn, has you worried about the maintenance that is occurring behind the scenes. To that end, as you go around the Jurassic park water ride you tend to see some broken dinosours that haven't been fixed or maybe haven't been noticed. In any case, this was another example of cost cutting at resorts world sentosa. Would I consider going with the family again......not anytime soon. With the exception of mi ions land, the rest of the park has been the same for almost 2 decades and is starting to feel it.",

The park overall was okay, we loved Shrek far far away land. And the waffle with ice cream scoop was so so good!! The only reason why the park didnt get 5 stars is because the water world show was canceled, the water tube ride had technical difficulties and closed and also the jeep ride we went on got stuck so we had to stop mid ride and be evacuated.",

Fun Transformers, Cyclones, etc. And before riding Jurassic Park, prepare a raincoat in case you get wet, but there is no need for that. Even if it's wet, it's only slightly wet, so just ride it. Maybe that's why you have to pay 4 per hour to use the locker here, but you can just bring it and use it. It's an expensive bag, so if you don't want it to get wet, you can put it in a supermarket plastic bag. For reference, it is very helpful to prepare a towel when leaving the hotel. And Jurassic Park isn't that great. Cyclon and Transformers are the most fun. I also recommend Shrek.",

On arrival my girlfriend and I tried to enter the main entrance but were directed to a 'VIP' lounge which was a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately my delight abruptly dissolved when we walked into the 'VIP lounge' as it resembled a kindergarten with screaming kids and stressed-looking parents everywhere. We were greeted by staff who looked like they were forcing a smile upon their faces and given a cold drink. I then had a 'terms and conditions' document thrust in front of me to sign, as the staff member used her finger to highlight and verbally describe that it was not a private tour and that we would be with 12 other people with no mention of children. As I looked around the chaotic child-filled room I instantly realised that I'd been had. I calmly pointed out that I did not spend over GBP500 to spend the day with screaming children and that their literature had not indicated such information. I then spent the next 15 minutes speaking to three different members of staff whose seniority went up when the last one failed to appease me. I ended up speaking to a female manager of some sort who essentially accused me of discriminating against children. For a manager or supervisor overseeing a VIP team I was quite shocked to hear the word 'discriminate' in the context of our conversation. It is a very provocative word and to use in these circumstances showed extremely poor judgement and an attitude which suggested that I had somehow committed an offence for expecting a VIP tour to be with adults. Clearly there is an ongoing issue with what the Universal Studios literature and advertising suggests in order to raise your expectations of how the tour will be conducted because if there was not, why are the staff at pains to only point out that you will be with 12 other 'participants' on the VIP tour but not highlight anything else? I think if Universal Studios (US) uses clear advertising to suggest that US is for adults as well as children, which it does, I think it is perfectly reasonable to make it clear that when you take a VIP tour, you are very likely to spend the day with up to 10 children and parents. However according to the VIP Team supervisor, this would be discrimination! I think perhaps Universal Studios should give their staff more training on communication skills and using non-provocative language if in fact the individual knows the true meaning of the word in the first place. After this distasteful experience, our VIP Tour guide for the day was absolutely fabulous and really knew how to salvage the day for us. In conclusion, I would not recommend the VIP tour unless you are happy to spend the day with children. Otherwise we had a good day.",

Sadly, we tried 3-4 days ago and couldn't get it. Now, it's not the end of the world if you go without those special passes. Choose the top 4-5 rides, you definitely want to try. You can easily cover at least 3 within the first hour (i.e. 10-11 am). Just don't stop anywhere for a photo/washrooms/anything else. You will get enough time later. We managed to cover Battlestar human (found less thrilling), Mummy (must do, we did it 2 times) and transformers (next best to Mummy) by 11. We managed to do the Battlestar cylon (which was also ok type) without much wait later in the day as soon as it restarted after a technical glitch. Look for such opportunities. I saw other comments about locker charges. There are charges, but do note that first 45 min Or so (each time you rent, you will see on the display), it is free of cost. So don't worry too much about it if you can manage within that time window. I think I saw comments about the drinking water issue as well. It's not the case. There are drinking water facilities near the washrooms throughout the park. It is also available in the queue of some of the rides, like transformers. You don't have to purchase it by paying huge money. The food may not be very costly. We ate at a pizza place. A full pizza, cold drink, a desert cost 60-65 which was more than enough for the three of us. 20 on an average is not a bad deal. Right? Lastly, not every ride is worth it, so plan before you enter the park. Shrek, accelerator were among the ones we regretted going. The Spielberg one also took time, it was ok.

Its way less crowded and much more enjoyable. Arrive when the park opens. We went on a weekday during a non-peak season , early in the day, wait times were about 1530 minutes, but later in the afternoon, most rides were only 5 minutes. We got to enjoy everything and even did some rides more than once! Avoid peak periods if possible. During busy times, youll end up waiting in long lines under the heat and humidity. Ticket prices for adults start from SGD 62 (depending on the website and promotions). Check the official Resorts World Sentosa website for the most accurate price. Express Pass info: Universal Express: Starts from SGD 90 per person. Lets you skip the queue once per ride. Universal Express Plus: Starts from SGD 120 per person. Lets you skip the queue as many times as you want on each ride. (Both are only valid on the day of your visit) My advice: If youre going on a weekday and outside of peak season, you probably dont need the Express Pass, the lines are short enough, and youll save money!",

It a show to show the magic of virtual effects with a 5-degree typhoon hitting a a small Boat house in New York. I place is worth the money with many facilities like food stalls, restrooms, drinkable water stands, wheelchairs, prams, and medical aid spots.

However, a couple of rides had a separate line for single individuals like me. These people accomodate you you if a single seat is available in the ride and you get to enjoy the much much quickly. Although the photographs are chargable in the shows, you can quickly take a selfie (if you are quick enough) and avoid spendling money on photographs and standing in lomg queues.",

Go play Madakaka Just wait in line for a moment and then you can play. Next, we went into the Egyptian zone and waited for a very long time, over an hour. It was a roller coaster ride that ran in the dark. It was very exciting. There was going forward and down, turning curves, and going backwards, so thrilling that we screamed a lot. Some people may not be too thrilled. I took my mother to play and she felt fine. She didn't cry at all. Later, she came to play in the Transformers zone. It's a 3D player. That sways along with the story. It's very exciting. I took my mother to play this one too. It's very fun. Come and play in the Jurassic zone. The queue was long enough. This one is wet. Prepare a raincoat. So it's not very wet. Excited again I got to play around 7:00 p.m. My time here was fine. It was enough to use and it was worth the card. But unfortunately, when it rains and is dry, we can't go anywhere for more than an hour. Otherwise, I might be able to collect more than this.",

Transformers - feel very realistic 3. Lights, Camera, Action show - we will feel there is real tsunami. 4. Jurassic Park - end is a twist 5. Galactica and cylon - these are very adventurous and recommend to the young people with no fear of heights. Overall, it is a good place to visit. Only bad part is they don't introduce new rides often. Same rides for the whole year except Halloween day show which is every year.",

Apart from that, there is also a 3D museum, an aquarium with various types of sea animals, places to eat, places to buy souvenirs, cafes, and several other games, as well as interesting photo spots for those of you who want selfies or wefies with friends and family. you guys.. Don't worry about your belongings while playing there, because there are several paid storage places in the form of self-service lockers provided, but they have a time limit, so when the time is up, the locker key will automatically open by itself, but you can still extend it by Pay again at the machine, or move to another locker closest to the game you want to try next! Don't forget to provide small money to pay at the locker machine! It's best if you want to visit and try all the rides there, you have to come from the moment they open and spend your time there all day until they close again, because to try just one ride, you still have to queue long according to the time and moment you are at. come there, unless you buy a USS express ticket, you still have to queue, but not as long as the regular queue... For food, it's a good idea to bring your own from outside!! Because there are many food places there that provide food that doesn't suit our taste buds and the prices are quite expensive!!! But again, it depends on individual tastes...Hehe And one more thing, if you are interested in trying all the rides there, it would be better if you bought tickets outside the area or at the travel agent where you come from, because of course, the price will be much cheaper...",

Not just in terms of rides, the plus points of location, d the food, service and even signages. This has got to be one of the best that i had been to actually. I dont boast bout my own country, unless it is good, but i found out why.. I was actually reserved bout this place since there were other good theme parks in other parts of the world. But after exepriencing it again, USS made me feel like a kid again. The queues were as long as half hour, some lesser, and some longer. But that didnt stop us from riding the rides. It was superb! Hahaha.. Staff were calm to explain and funny, even witty at times. Place was clean and wel maintained. A top rated theme park as a whole.. Didnt grab much photos koz we were too busy having fun. As a summary,we would recommend this to anyone. Just an advise. Bring cash.. And lots of it, koz u WILL NEED IT.. Cheers!! #uss #universalstudio #singapore #universalstudiosingapore",

(Please don't go for them if you can't handle it .. the rides are safe but might not be enjoyable for everyone) Rides: 1. BattleStar Galactica (human,cylon): This is c.r.a.z.y. Youll get flipped in every possible direction and won't be able to figure out which is sky and which is ground. At some points you'll feel like you're gonna hurtle into the crowd below but be assured that the ride was pretty safe when we were on it. They'll just strap you on and you'll think that you'll get a couple of seconds to prepare yourself but no .. :D you'll start screaming three seconds into the ride and get out of your seats at the end with jelly legs. There are two variations, try the white roller coaster (cylon) if you want a scarier ride. 2. Transformers 3D ride: This concept is so cool. For anyone who is a Transformers fan, this is a treat. Not very scary, but it's like being in visual reality. I really recommend this one, and it's not scary at all. Really enjoyable, rather, in fact I wanted to go twice. 3. Jurassic Park rapids: Low key water ride. No adrenaline rushes, you can just chill and float the whole way in a tube car. 4. Revenge of the Mummy: It's in the Ancient Egypt theme park and not as crazy as the Battlestar Galactica but nevertheless good. There's a steep drop at the end which makes it enjoyable. Other attractions include a BumbleBee danceoff (which is really cute), the Water World show at Jurassic Park The Lost World (interactive - they will get the audience wet so front row viewers beware :D), a few other rides for kids at Far Far Away and Madagascar.",

The park boasts a number of distinct zones from some of their most popular franchises and offer some really great experiences even just walking around. If you're an adrenaline junkie, you might be slightly disappointed by the number of rides catering more towards kids and families but these are still genuinely fun experiences. The highlight is definitely the twin looping coasters based on the Battlestar Galactica franchise with its high-speed launches and turns, this is one ride you'll definitely want to try at least once. Be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours during peak periods of the year unless you're willing to fork out the unlimited express pass (90) which will get you to the rides in as fast a third of the time.",

The HUMAN coaster is good for those who might have some fear of roller coasters, but if you dont, I highly recommend CYLON. Also, the Mummy is amazing as well. My favorite ride has to be the Jurassic Park Rapids, however. Overall, I love this theme park and would recommend it if youre in Singapore.",

Its not very scary anymore, but its a very unforgettable night.

Went using a 2 day pass and still it was not enough to cover all the attractions. It can be very crowded and for the best of rides there could be more than hour long queueu.

If you don't purchase an Express ticket, you may have to wait in line for 2-3 hours on some rides. If you're only going to be able to ride a few stations, boredom will replace the fun. And that day will be the day you are not impressed. The most impressive player Egypt looks like a museum at first glance. But once you enter, it becomes an extremely thrilling roller coaster. Adding to the fear of darkness It's a plaything that isn't child friendly at all. Please prepare yourself for the thrill and fear first. Transformers the ride is a simulator that projects 3D images as if we were actually in the vehicle. It is very fun and realistic. Human vs. Cylon, this one is the most brutal, a rollercoaster. Human rides on a train, while Cylon hangs his legs and plays with his hands completely numb. The greatest thrill has to be these two. The three types above are my favorites, but there are many others that I'm also impressed by. But if you don't want to lose your temper and waste all day waiting in line. Don't forget to buy Express tickets before entering. Have a fun trip.",

With its wide range of thrilling rides and attractions, it has become a top tourist destination for families and friends alike. I recently had the opportunity to visit the park, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience. The first thing that struck me about Universal Studio Singapore was its impressive collection of rides. From heart-pumping roller coasters to interactive simulators, there was something for everyone. One of my personal favorites was the Transformer ride, which was an incredible 3D experience that transported me into the world of the Autobots and Decepticons. It was so realistic that I felt like I was part of the action. However, it's worth noting that the park can get quite crowded on weekends and holidays. This can lead to long wait times for the rides and difficulty navigating through the crowds. However, if you plan your visit during the weekdays, the park is significantly less crowded, and you can enjoy all the rides and attractions without having to wait in long lines. Despite the crowds, the overall atmosphere of the park is infectious. There's a palpable energy and excitement in the air that is hard to describe. The park is immaculately maintained, and the staff is friendly and helpful. One downside to visiting Universal Studio Singapore is that you'll need a full day to enjoy everything the park has to offer. In fact, it took me around six hours to explore the entire park and experience all the rides. That said, it's worth every minute, as the memories you'll make here are priceless. In conclusion, if you're looking for a fun-filled adventure, Universal Studio Singapore is an absolute must-visit. The park's fantastic rides, thrilling attractions, and energetic atmosphere make it a unique and unforgettable experience. Just remember to plan your visit during the weekdays to avoid the crowds and make the most out of your time here.",

                "review_text": "Had lots of fun at USS! I went during the Singapore school holidays. Even though I didnt buy the express tickets, the queues were not as long as I expected and the longest I had to queue for was only 45min. The rest of the queues were much better and only took around 5-15min! Towards the end, at around 4pm, most of the people had left and there was barely any queues. Even though waterworld was not open, there was still a decent number of rides I could go on. I really enjoyed the roller coasters! For those tho like extreme rides, they are definitely recommended. But for those who are ok with a bit of extreme, but not too much, Mummy is a perfect ride. But I dont recommend Mummy to those who are scared of the dark. Transformers is a really thrilling 3D ride which is suitable for all ages. It is not scary but mainly exciting. Everyone should try transformers! As for Enchanted Airways I think is it alright for ages 7 and above. It honestly depends on how brave your child is It is actually a mini roller coaster and its super fun! I really enjoyed Canopy Flyer too! You can choose to either sit facing forwards or going backwards. The view is really nice from up there and I recommend to everyone! Lastly, there is the Jurassic water ride . (Im not sure what its called) A super thrilling and exciting ride where you are seated with a few other people in this circle like boat. Then, you will go down a river with occasional waterfalls, small drop-downs and dinosaurs which spray water at you! At the very last part, there is a pretty big drop that will get everyone soaked!! (If you want to go on this ride but you do not want to get wet, I recommend bringing your own raincoat! Because the raincoats they sell there are super expensive at 5SGD each!!) I would definitely recommend eating outside of USS (for example at the malaysian food centre) because the food and drinks inside USS are really expensive! One small bottle of drinking water can be 4SGD and one cup of slushee was around 8-12SGD Lets not talk about how expensive the food was too. The staff were really friendly overall but there was one time when it was my turn to go on the Human roller coaster, the staff which helps scan our pockets was not so friendly. After she had scanned my pockets, I kindly asked her if I could sit at the last row but she looked irritated and just nodded her head. The second time I went on Human, I also asked if I could sit at the last row again. This time, the lady literally rolled her eyes at me and didnt even reply me. I was super disappointed and really annoyed at her behavior. After that, I didnt want to go on Human again because of that staff. But overall, the rest of the staff were friendly and helpful! Another recommendation I have for those who have not visited before is to arrive about an hour before the park opens. This way, you can quickly queue at the gate and you would be one of the first few people to enter the park. Then you can quickly rush to the rides so that you would not have to queue so much at the beginning. Overall, I had a really great time at USS. I definitely recommend coming here. If you are afraid that there would be many people, I think you should really get the express unlimited tickets. You would be able to go on the rides many more times. :)",

From heart-pounding rides to valuable pro tips, the experience was a perfect blend of excitement and satisfaction. 1. TRANSFORMERS The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle - 5/5 A must-visit attraction, the Transformers ride delivered an ultimate 3D battle against the forces of evil. Racing through the cityscape, zipping through subway tunnels, and navigating high-rise rooftops, it offered a truly immersive and thrilling experience. 2. Battlestar-galactica - 4.5/5 For adrenaline junkies, the Battlestar Galactica dual roller coasters were a highlight. The high-speed, heart-pounding ride catered to those who crave the rush of speed and the scream-inducing thrills of a roller coaster. 3. Revenge of the Mummy - 4/5 The indoor roller coaster, Revenge of the Mummy, plunged us into total darkness, subjecting us to unexpected fireballs, swarms of scarab beetles, and an army of warrior mummies. The surprise elements and immersive atmosphere made it a memorable experience. Pro Tips for a Seamless Visit: Baggage Caution: Avoid carrying excessive bags or luggage, as lockers are available at a charge. Keep in mind that these lockers can be pricey. Food Inspection: Refrain from carrying food items, as surprise inspections may lead to their removal. Camera Considerations: Leave professional bulky DSLR cameras behind, as many rides require empty pockets. Free lockers are conveniently provided at ride entrances. Queue Strategy: Optimal ride enjoyment can be achieved by heading to the last ride first, minimizing wait times. Evening visits, especially in the last hour before closing, offer shorter queues. Breakfast Necessity: Ensure a hearty breakfast to sustain energy throughout the day of adventures. In Conclusion: Our visit to Universal Studios Singapore was a whirlwind of excitement, laughter, and adrenaline. The well-crafted rides, coupled with invaluable pro tips, ensured a seamless and enjoyable experience. While the park's policies on bags and food may pose minor inconveniences, the overall thrill and magic of Universal Studios make it a destination worth revisiting. With a 4/5 rating, Universal Studios Singapore promises a fantastic time for thrill-seekers and movie enthusiasts alike. We left with unforgettable memories and a definite eagerness to return.",

The immersive experiences, sharp turns, and steep drops made for an unforgettable adventure. But it wasn't all about the rides - the WaterWorld show was a spectacular display of stunts, pyrotechnics, and action-packed fun. I was on the edge of my seat as the performers pulled off daring feats and explosive stunts. After all that excitement, I needed some retail therapy, and the Transformer shop delivered! I geeked out over the impressive collection of Autobot and Decepticon merchandise, and scored some awesome souvenirs to take home. The park's theming, attention to detail, and friendly staff all added to the magic of the day. Whether you're a fan of movies, TV shows, or just plain old-fashioned fun, Universal Studios Singapore has something for everyone. Highly recommend to buy express ride tickets. In short, USS is a must-visit destination for any thrill-seeker or pop culture enthusiast. Get ready for a day of non-stop action, adventure, and unforgettable memories!",

The climbing speed is faster than regular roller coasters in Japan. That also amplifies the thrill. Such attractions are good, but simulation-based ones have a language barrier that reduces the fun. No, anything else. That's your responsibility. It's my fault that I didn't study properly.

And water is not cheap either! 3. Eat before you go... so you have energy, and so you wont need to spend so much on food when you are there. Unless of course if you are there for the food too. 4.

We have purchased the Express pass, by around 1pm we have finished all games we want to try. So I think an Express pass is not a absolute must like what happened in USJ. The scariest ride is definitely Revenge of the Mummy. Discouraged anyone who can't handle a roller coaster ride to try. It happened in darkness, there is scary element, and the falls is rapid and happened in a row. So yeah, it is exciting and scary.",

Imagine a place where you can step into your favorite films, from battling Decepticons with the Autobots to braving the Lost World with dinosaurs , feeling like you're the star of your own blockbuster adventure! Picture yourself screaming your lungs out on a rollercoaster , high-fiving your favorite movie characters , and maybe even getting soaked on a water ride (spoiler alert: you *will* get soaked!) . You can explore different themed zones, from Ancient Egypt to New York City, feeling like you've traveled the world in a single day! It's a place where you can feel like you're starring in your own action-packed movie! However, let's be honest, sometimes \"theme park\" can feel a bit like a real-life game of \"dodge the strollers,\" where you're trying to navigate the crowds while also trying to avoid getting your toes run over . And while the thrills are undeniably amazing, you might also find yourself questioning your ability to resist the urge to buy all the souvenirs, especially if you're a sucker for a character-themed plushie or a limited-edition popcorn bucket . Plus, those queues can get long, so pack your patience and maybe a snack or two! Overall, Universal Studios Singapore offers an unforgettable and exhilarating experience, a place where you can unleash your inner child, create lasting memories, and maybe even conquer your fear of heights, even if you sometimes feel like youre participating in a synchronized queueing session with a hundred other thrill-seeking adventurers. Get ready for a day of fun, laughter, and maybe a few screams!",

And if you're a film buff? The park layout is loaded with references, details, and hidden Easter eggs that'll have you pointing things out like you're on a behind-the-scenes tour.
