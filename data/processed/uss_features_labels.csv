I was one of the earliest people to get on too. -The ticket price was still full price even though some major attractions like Transformers: The Ride and Waterworld were closed. No discounts offered. -Waiting time not accurate. -Some rides, like Canopy Flyer, suddenly broke down and we had to wait ages for them to fix it. The staff didnt take the initiative to explain things. -The park closed early at 7PM. The lights had just turned on and everything looked so nice for photos, but we had to leave. No light show, water show, or fireworks either. -The Q system was ok la.. but there were no chairs. Standing for so long was exhausting! -The restaurant was too crowded and the food was just ok. Tips if Youre Planning to Go: -Get there before 8.30AM to avoid the crowds and long queues. -Bring your own water bottlethere are refill stations. -Check the Sentosa website for maintenance updates, opening hours and etc. -Hit the popular rides first, and then pick ones with shorter waiting time as you go. -Always check the weather forecast beforehand, even if its not 100% accurate. -Do some research and read reviews or other peoples experiences before buying tickets and planning your day. -Go on weekdays and avoid peak months and public holidays. Overall: This is my first theme park, but I think it might be average compared to others. Thankfully, I didnt run into any really serious problems like some others did.

My girlfriend, who came after, was unsure of where to queue due to the lack of clear signage and accidentally entered the express queue. We looked back at him and he corrected us. However, we then heard a remark right after (either directed at us or him speaking to his colleague) that had an extremely sarcastic and rude tone, that went along the line of ""Already say queue that side right?"" which was so uncalled for and made us feel disrespected.

67,5,user_67,"Universal Studios Singapore is one of the best entertainment destinations for families with children. The park offers many attractions inspired by popular films, and its various themed zones mean that everyone will find something for themselves. Attractions for children This place was created for the youngest! Many attractions are adapted for children, and meetings with cartoon characters add magic to the entire visit. However, it is worth checking whether a given attraction is suitable for your child before entering - the staff does not always pay attention to this, which can result in an unpleasant surprise. Queues and VIP tickets Some attractions are very popular, which means long queues. It is possible to buy a VIP ticket, which allows you to use priority entry, but in my opinion it is not worth overpaying for this privilege - it is better to plan your visit to avoid the largest crowds. Rollercoasters and thrills The park offers amazing rollercoasters that provide a solid dose of adrenaline. Battlestar Galactica: HUMAN vs. is especially worth trying. CYLON, which is one of the most exciting rollercoasters in Asia. Planning your day and returning You can spend practically the whole day at Universal Studios Singapore, but it is worth leaving a little earlier to avoid long lines for the return train. The park is very dynamic - there are many shows and performances on the streets, so there is always something going on.

Instead, the park uses Universal licenses and has a mix of familiar and unfamiliar attractions based on Universal franchises. I mention this because the park looks very much like the other Universal Studios parks but feels a little cheaper. Even identical attractions had corners cut so the magic isn't quite the same. If you are familiar with the typical Universal experience, set your expectations accordingly. That said, the park is fun. Is it the best Universal Studios themed park? Not even close but that doesn't mean it is horrible. The most unique standout attraction is Battlestar Galactica. This is a pair of roller coasters, one a calmer sit down coaster and the other a thrilling inverted coaster, that intertwine with each other.

98,5,user_98,"Okay, buckle up, thrill-seekers, because Universal Studios Singapore isn't just a theme park it's a full-throttle adventure that blasts you straight into the heart of your favorite movies! From the moment you step through those iconic gates, you're immersed in a world where fantasy becomes reality, and the excitement is absolutely contagious. For me, the highlights were undoubtedly the pulse-pounding rides and spectacular shows that brought cinematic magic to life. The Transformers: The Ride was an absolute game-changer. The seamless blend of 3D visuals and motion simulation made me feel like I was right there alongside Optimus Prime, battling Decepticons in a truly epic showdown. Seriously, the sheer scale and intensity of this ride are mind-blowing hold on tight! Then there's WaterWorld, a live-action stunt show that left me utterly speechless. The incredible acrobatics, pyrotechnics, and jet ski stunts performed right before your eyes are nothing short of breathtaking. The sheer commitment and skill of the performers, combined with the explosive special effects, make this a must-see spectacle that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Be prepared to get a little wet in the front rows it's all part of the fun! For a dose of fairytale charm and heartwarming humor, the Shrek 4-D Adventure is an absolute delight. This immersive experience perfectly captures the wit and charm of the Shrek movies, with fantastic 3D effects and in-theater sensations that bring the story to life in a whole new way. It's a perfect break from the high-octane rides and a guaranteed smile-inducer for all ages. And speaking of bringing movies to life, Lights, Camera, Action! Hosted by Steven Spielberg is a masterclass in special effects wizardry. Witnessing the raw power of Hollywood filmmaking unfold before your eyes, from raging storms to dramatic explosions, is truly captivating. It offers a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into the magic of cinema and leaves you with a newfound appreciation for the artistry involved. But Universal Studios Singapore offers so much more beyond these incredible highlights. Wandering through the various themed zones, from the ancient Egypt of Revenge of the Mummy to the lost world of Jurassic Park, is an adventure in itself. The attention to detail in the set design and atmosphere is remarkable, making you feel truly transported to these different worlds. The thrill rides are diverse and cater to all levels of adrenaline junkies. Whether you're soaring through the air on the Battlestar Galactica dueling rollercoasters (HUMAN vs. CYLON is an experience you won't soon forget!) or braving the rapids of the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, there's something to get your heart racing. Beyond the rides and shows, the park is also filled with fantastic dining options and opportunities to meet your favorite characters. From snapping a photo with the Minions to indulging in themed treats, the entire experience is designed to immerse you in the world of movies.

Here are a few extra tips to make the most of your visit: * Arrive early: This will give you a head start on the crowds and allow you to experience more rides and attractions with shorter wait times. * Plan your day: Take a look at the park map and show schedules beforehand to prioritize your must-see attractions. * Utilize the Universal Express Pass: If you're short on time or visiting during peak season, the Express Pass can significantly reduce your wait times for many popular rides and shows. * Stay hydrated: Singapore's tropical climate can be hot and humid, so remember to drink plenty of water throughout the day. * Wear comfortable shoes",5/16/25,Weekend,No wait,high_tolerance,59.400000000000006,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.8768,0.12,0.08333333333333333,0.998,0.0,0.0,0.9201,0.11399999999999999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.998,0,1,0,0,0.5,7,6,5,0.4305555555555556,1.0,1.0,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.4239299253697781,0.155,0.5,0.0,0.0

I came alone and didn't need to queue to enter the park. Many attractions also have express lanes for single people. The queuing time for each attraction is much shorter compared to Universal Studios in other countries. The longest queuing time is forty minutes, but only for individual projects. Moreover, there is a limited park - Hello Kitty that is not available in other countries. The Sanrio characters in it are particularly cute and good-looking. I bought a lot of goods, and if there are any unsatisfactory quality issues, you can return or exchange them at any time with the receipt. Especially, an intern clerk named ""Joycelyn""mylamerilyn has a particularly good service attitude. She is serious in her work and has a good attitude.

I recently visited Universal Studios Singapore for the first time, and overall, it was a fantastic experience filled with excitement, nostalgia, and adventure. As someone who has never been to a Universal Studios park before, I was genuinely impressed by the vibrant atmosphere, the immersive themes, and the sheer scale of the park. It truly brings your favorite movies and characters to life in a way that feels magical. Theming & Attractions: From the moment you step in, the level of detail in the parks design is jaw-dropping. Each zoneHollywood, New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, and Madagascaris beautifully themed and transports you into a completely different world. I particularly enjoyed the Revenge of the Mummy ride in Ancient Egypt and the Transformers 3D ride in Sci-Fi Cityboth were thrilling and well worth the hype! Shows & Entertainment: The live shows and street performances were also a pleasant surprise. The WaterWorld stunt show was incredibly well-executed, with amazing effects and high energy. There were also plenty of characters walking around for photos, which added to the experience. Food & Facilities: Food options were decent, with a variety of choices catering to different tastes, though a bit on the pricier side (as expected in theme parks). The park was clean, well-maintained, and had plenty of rest areas, shaded spots, and clean restrooms. Crowds & Waiting Times: This was the only downside to my visit. While I anticipated some waiting, I was a bit overwhelmed by the length of the queuesespecially for the popular rides. Even with a weekday visit, some lines were over an hour long, which really ate into the time we had to explore everything. I highly recommend arriving early and possibly investing in the Universal Express Pass if your budget allowsit makes a big difference. Staff & Service: The staff throughout the park were friendly, helpful, and very professional. They did a great job managing the crowds and keeping the lines moving as efficiently as possible. Final Thoughts: Universal Studios Singapore is absolutely worth a visit, especially if youre a fan of movie-themed attractions. Its a great mix of thrill rides, shows, and immersive environments that appeal to all ages. Just go in preparedwear comfortable shoes, stay hydrated, and if youre not a fan of long waits, consider the Express Pass.

Just show a valid ID and collect a special birthday badge and a gift voucher (mine included retail discounts and a free souvenir)! Stay Hydrated & Take Breaks: Singapore weather can be humid. Use the shaded areas and indoor shows (like WaterWorld or Shrek 4D) as fun breaks between rides.

148,5,user_148,"Lovely place, enjoyedUniversal Studios Singapore, located on Sentosa Island, stands out as Southeast Asias premier movie-themed amusement park, offering a vibrant mix of adrenaline-pumping rides, immersive attractions, and family-friendly entertainment. The park is thoughtfully divided into six immersive zones, each themed around blockbuster films and iconic locations, such as Hollywood, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, and the newly opened Minion Land. As you enter past the iconic Universal globe, youre greeted by Hollywood Boulevards retro charm, lined with themed dining and shopping options, setting the stage for a day of cinematic adventure. Rides and Attractions: Universal Studios Singapore boasts over 20 rides and attractions, catering to every thrill level and age group. Highlights for thrill-seekers include the Battlestar Galactica: HUMAN vs. CYLON, a pair of dueling roller coasters that reach speeds up to 90 km/h and feature dramatic loops, near-miss moments, and exhilarating drops. Transformers: The Ride 3D is widely praised for its cutting-edge visuals and immersive motion-simulator experience, placing guests in the heart of a battle between Autobots and Decepticons. The Revenge of the Mummy indoor coaster delivers high-speed twists and turns in near darkness, while Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure provides a soaking, dinosaur-filled river journey. For families and younger visitors, attractions like Shrek 4-D Adventure, Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase, and King Juliens Beach Party-Go-Round offer gentle fun and interactive storytelling. The new Minion Land adds even more family appeal, with rides like Despicable Me Minion Mayhem and the Buggie Boogie carousel, plus lively character meet-and-greets and themed shops. Shows and Entertainment: Beyond rides, the park excels in live entertainment. Popular shows include Water World, a stunt-filled aquatic spectacle, and Lights, Camera, Action!, which reveals the magic behind blockbuster special effects. Street performances, musical parades, and character appearances (from Minions to Shrek and even classic icons like Charlie Chaplin) add to the festive atmosphere. Visitor Experience: The park is praised for its clean, well-organized layout and the sheer variety of attractions that can easily fill a full day. Express Pass options allow guests to skip long lines, though its important to note that some passes only allow one express entry per ride. Early entry is highly recommended, especially on weekends or holidays, to maximize your experience and minimize wait times. Dining options are diverse, ranging from quick snacks to themed restaurants, and the parks size makes it manageable for families with children. Considerations: While most reviews are overwhelmingly positive, some visitors have noted that customer service can be inconsistent, and wet weather may lead to temporary ride closures, so planning ahead is advisable. The cost of admission is higher than many other attractions in Singapore, but most agree the experience justifies the price, especially for fans of movies and theme parks. Conclusion: Universal Studios Singapore delivers a world-class theme park experience with a unique Southeast Asian twist. Its blend of thrilling rides, immersive zones, engaging shows, and family-friendly attractions ensures theres something for everyone, making it a must-visit destination for locals and tourists alike",5/13/25,Weekend,1030 min,high_tolerance,30.0,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.981,0.183,0.3,0.9963,0.0,0.0,0.9349,0.176,0.0,0.177,0.0,0.9963,0,1,0,20,0.5,10,8,8,0.3480769230769231,1.0,1.0,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.09976771196283392,0.174,0.5,0.0,0.16666666666666666

We also noticed negatively the employees who, in a very unsympathetic way, made room for the ""Raptor"" appearance in the Jurasic Park area. In general, the way you can use photos to show characters like Shrek and Co is also not nice. You stand in line for ages and are pushed through by the employees in a rude tone.

It's humid and hotter than this time of year in Japan (end of April), so I think I focused on indoor attractions in order to cool down. There seemed to be one or two lined up outside... There was a charge for lockers to store luggage at Jurassic. I personally thought Wicked's goods were better than those in Japan, so I bought a lot of them.

From Hollywood Boulevard to The Lost World, every area is full of details and immersion. In particular, the facilities such as Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy, and Jurassic River Adventure are really recommended, as they are exciting and story-telling. If there are fewer people on weekdays, the queue time is acceptable; on holidays, you really need to come early, otherwise the wait for popular facilities will be quite long. The cleanliness and services inside the park are very good, and the performances are also exciting. It is a place suitable for adults and children to relax together. The only reason I deducted one star is because the park is relatively small and it is easier to walk around after experiencing several large facilities. In addition, the dining in the park is more expensive and has fewer choices. It would be even more attractive if one or two major new facilities could be added.

One larger than the other kinds. 3] There are rides like Transformers which are kind of virtual roller coaster rides and it is one of the top most attraction apart from roller coaster. 4] There are many rides like Puss in the boots which are for smaller kids 5] They also have 2-3 shows which are basically live and are arranged for only twice a day and run for 45 mins in each run. Please check the timings of the show as soon as you enter to enjoy them throughly.

Ticket Prices Are High A one-day adult ticket can cost SGD 8298 (around USD 6072), and express passes add another SGD 40100. For that price, visitors expect more fully functioning attractions and smoother operations. 2. Multiple Ride Closures or Technical Issues Key attractions like WaterWorld and Amber Rock Climb are closed. Others like Transformers and Canopy Flyer have frequent delays or breakdowns. With only about 78 major rides, even 23 closed significantly reduces the value. 3. Food Is Exorbitantly Priced Basic vegetarian meals (like rice with vegetables or noodles) can cost SGD 1520 per person. Snacks like popcorn, ice cream, or drinks are overpriced, especially with no outside food allowed. Limited budget or vegetarian options add to the difficulty. 4.

First of all there were long queue in front of us and we werent sure which Q we are supposed to wait. There should have been proper Q ribbons extending all the way to manage the Q and provide proper labeling for each Q. This would help for newcomers as we do not want to end up in the wrong queue and waste a lot of time. Even we were a family, we were provided three separate QR codes each in a separate e ticket file. We ended up spending lot of time opening the unique qr code and gaining entry. Our child was in a stroller and they made individual persons to walk across the entry gate one by one which I have never seen in any other place. While doing that my childs stroller got stuck in between the gates and I had to forcefully pull it out. This could have been avoided easily. Little did we know this was beginning of our disappointments in the so called popular over hyped amusement park. Once we downloaded their mobile app, we got to know the dreaded wait times. Some rides had 150 minutes (2.5 hours) !!!! Really ?? There is no point in reaching early or trying rides during lunch hours. The number of visitors are so huge, it doesnt make any sense. Do you want us to spend the whole day just for one ride? You need to be really crazy to wait hours for just one ride. There must be some rides dedicated for kids. Here in minion park, adults were doing merry go round. Though wait time was shown as 30mins we waited for more than 1 hour for a ride of hardly 60 seconds. Also USS should take example from river wonders in Mandai and provide proper shades as it is really difficult to roam around in scorching heat. Except for the Revenge of the Mummy and Transformers rides, I didnt find other rides any different from the ones we see in usual parks. Also USS doesnt understand capacity. They are just allowing infinite number of visitors to this place which isnt large enough to hold all of them or entertain them. You have queues even to get food or drinks or snacks or anything. Coming to the shows, they are all sub standard. We have witnessed much better shows in universities or malls. To top it all, water world show was closed due to maintenance. My final advice to everyone looking forward to visiting USS, if you have already been to any amusement park in your country/city, this place is not worth your time and money.

For example, the Transformers queue lasted for forty or fifty minutes. It was a VR battle scene. The realism was not bad, and the shaking was a bit interesting. It was quite consistent with the real shaking. There's also Revenge of the Mummy, which is an average-level thrill ride and a decent indoor roller coaster, but the crazy dash part is too dark and you can't see anything. The two-track roller coaster and Zhuluo River were not going well that day. Halfway through the queue, they suddenly said they had to wait for maintenance, and soon after they said there was a malfunction and they couldn't play. After playing another roller coaster, I rearranged the ride to drift. Unfortunately, the double track was closed later that day. There are many others.

296,4,user_296,"Take note if you want to make the most of your visit to Universal Studios Singapore: Go on a weekday, not during weekends or school/public holidays. Its way less crowded and much more enjoyable. Arrive when the park opens. We went on a weekday during a non-peak season , early in the day, wait times were about 1530 minutes, but later in the afternoon, most rides were only 5 minutes. We got to enjoy everything and even did some rides more than once! Avoid peak periods if possible. During busy times, youll end up waiting in long lines under the heat and humidity. Ticket prices for adults start from SGD 62 (depending on the website and promotions). Check the official Resorts World Sentosa website for the most accurate price. Express Pass info: Universal Express: Starts from SGD 90 per person. Lets you skip the queue once per ride. Universal Express Plus: Starts from SGD 120 per person. Lets you skip the queue as many times as you want on each ride. (Both are only valid on the day of your visit) My advice: If youre going on a weekday and outside of peak season, you probably dont need the Express Pass, the lines are short enough, and youll save money!",5/1/25,Weekday,1030 min,high_tolerance,30.0,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.722,0.06,0.3333333333333333,0.8881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8881,1,0,0,20,0.5,0,0,4,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,1,0.18388472742405326,1.0,1.0,0.1712643638469038,0.071,0.5,0.0,0.16666666666666666

Use the MRT to get to UNIVA, and Singapore has a well-developed transportation network that is easy to understand, convenient, and fast. And you can go there safely and securely. And everyone is kind. After arriving at Univa, I was able to easily go around the attractions in about 2 hours and ride the attractions without waiting.

A couple of issues we had that I thought are worth mentioning, in case it helps someone else! * No re-entry is allowed. This was disappointing for us as a HUGE storm came across & closed down every ride, for quite some time (over an hour by the time we left & not looking like easing anytime soon). When all you can do is take shelter inside a shop or restaurant (however most of these are largely outdoor seating areas), it would have been great to able to get the Sentosa Express back to HarbourFront & get dry/fed & be able to go back once the weather cleared. Instead, we just left & didnt go back. * Waterworld was closed when we were there, this happens, I get it. The Minions ride broke down as my kids were queuing for it, with no re-opening time available. Given the cost of tickets (its not a cheap day out!) & putting up with things like this, I really think a re-entry option for weather, as stated above, would be a great gesture of goodwill. * Ride operators arent really behaving in the spirit of the place. One girl working the Transformers ride made our children completely exit the queue area because they had accidentally used the express lane without an express pass... only thing is, they were the only people in both the express & the ordinary lane.

The park is super well-organized, clean, and full of fun vibes. We started off with the Transformers ride seriously one of the coolest 3D rides Ive ever been on. The kids were screaming (in a good way), and even the adults were hyped. Then we hit up Jurassic Park, got soaked on the river raft ride, and didnt even care because it was so much fun. One of the highlights? The Minion Mart and all the Despicable Me stuff my little cousin couldn't stop smiling. Oh, and dont miss the Revenge of the Mummy ride if you like a little thrill. Totally worth the wait! There are plenty of food options too from quick snacks to proper meals. We grabbed lunch at one of the themed diners and even found some halal choices, which was a plus for our family. Overall, it was such a wholesome day full of laughter, a bit of adrenaline, and tons of unforgettable memories.

568,2,user_567,Personally I do not think this is worth the money if you are visiting singapore especially if you have been to other universal studios this one falls flat on quality and size. The price is quite inflated and there are continuous costs. For instance I was told I should put my backpack in a locker so I paid 35 dollars outside the park to put my bag away and just kept a small cross body bag for my wallet. Then when you try and go on certian rides you thin need to buy a locked in the park for your smaller item and suddenly one ride is costing you 15 so you can store your bag for it. So if your alone this is an expensive day of storing your items and if your with people expect one person to sit out and wait with your bags The food as all theme parks go was of course over priced. But this is a pretty well known fact so always eat before and bring snacks. The size of the park is quite small compared to others and the majority of the rides were more or less 4d so your just sitting in a cart rattling with screens around you more than anything really. I do not recommend buying tickets at the gate as I found them through tour companies much cheaper,4/8/25,Weekday,No wait,tolerance_collapse,25.344,neutral,time_tolerant,-0.3102,-0.019,0.3333333333333333,0.6253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.002,0.3,0.6253,1,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,4,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0,0.12910944652517686,1.0,0.0,0.014934151643012402,0.035,0.0,0.0,0.0

576,5,user_575,"Since other places to visit in Singapore can easily be covered in half a day, I recommend spending a full day here. Since Disneyland and Universal Studio are located in certain countries, if you like theme parks, I think you should definitely visit them if they are available in the country you are visiting. I definitely recommend you come on weekdays and early in the morning. I arrived at 10 o'clock in the morning and first rode the Transformers ride, and although it was one of the most popular toys here, I did not wait in line at all, but after an hour, all the toys were full and the queues started to pile up. That's why I recommend you come as early as possible in the morning and ride the most popular rides before people get crowded. Also, the fast pass is just an added feature after purchasing the normal ticket. Do not buy it from the internet by mistake, otherwise you will have to buy an entry ticket again. I think if you are coming on a weekday, you do not need to buy a fast ticket, you can ride all of them with a little wait. There is no need to buy tickets online because the capacity of these parks is 50,000 people. I have never seen the tickets run out. You can buy them at the door with cash or card option. I recommend Transformers, Ancient Egypt, Human, and Jurassic Park, but ride knowing that in Jurassic Park you get quite wet, including your shoes. Water World was closed when I went, but it was among the must-visit places. The standard entrance ticket was 83 Singapore dollars, the price of adding the express pass was more expensive than the ticket. Also, if you follow the hours, Shrek and Minions characters greet each other and take photos. It is a very enjoyable and beautiful moment. I definitely recommend it.

662,4,user_661,"Universal Studios Singapore: Fun for Kids, But Expect Some Hiccups Universal Studios Singapore definitely offers a vibrant and exciting day out, particularly if you have kids in tow. The park is beautifully themed, and seeing characters like the Minions and Optimus Prime in real life brings a genuine sense of wonder to young faces. My children were absolutely thrilled by the Madagascar: A Crate Adventure boat ride and the Puss in Boots' Giant Journey suspended coaster when they were actually running. Unfortunately, our visit was significantly impacted by ride closures. The tropical climate of Singapore meant that several outdoor rides were temporarily shut down due to rain, which is understandable. However, we were also disappointed to find a noticeable number of attractions undergoing maintenance, further limiting our options. This was a real shame, especially for my kids who had been eagerly anticipating certain experiences. Despite the reduced ride availability, there was still enough to keep us occupied for a good portion of the day. The shows were entertaining, and the various themed zones offered plenty of photo opportunities and character meet-and-greets. The Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, even with the potential for getting soaked, was a definite highlight for the whole family. Food and beverage options within the park are plentiful, albeit on the pricier side, which is to be expected in a theme park. The staff were generally friendly and helpful, doing their best to manage the crowds and provide information about ride statuses. Overall, Universal Studios Singapore is a good experience, especially if your primary focus is entertaining younger children. The park has a unique charm and some genuinely fun attractions. However, the high likelihood of rain-related closures and the potential for maintenance disruptions mean it's not a guaranteed seamless experience. Would I say it's a must-visit in Singapore? Probably not. While we had a good time, the ride closures dampened the overall value proposition. If you have limited time in Singapore and prioritize must-see attractions, there might be other experiences that offer a more reliable and complete experience. However, if you have a few days, are traveling with kids who are big fans of the Universal franchises, and are prepared to be flexible with your itinerary due to potential ride disruptions, then Universal Studios Singapore can be a worthwhile one-time visit. Just be sure to check the park's website for any scheduled maintenance beforehand and be prepared to embrace the possibility of rain delays.",3/30/25,Weekend,1030 min,high_tolerance,30.0,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.4215,0.08,0.047619047619047616,0.8316,0.0,0.0,0.7351,0.205,0.0,0.306,0.0,0.9984,0,1,0,20,0.5,3,2,5,0.19,0.7,1.0,0,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.02370344643611425,0.238,1.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666

The park was overcrowded, and the overall experience felt underwhelming. There was nothing particularly special about it, and it lacked the magic and excitement we expected from a major theme park.

The heat was also unbearable, reaching at least 40C, and there was no air conditioning in indoor areas. Instead of offering a break from the extreme temperatures, the enclosed spaces felt suffocating.

From heart-pounding rides to captivating shows, it offers an unforgettable experience for all ages. Rides: The rides are simply awesome! I was particularly blown away by the Transformer ride a truly immersive and thrilling experience. The Minion and Shrek rides were also fantastic, providing a perfect blend of fun and entertainment. It's important to note that most rides require a minimum height of 102cm, so keep that in mind if you're traveling with young children. Shows: The shows are a major highlight! The outdoor dances, meet-and-greets, and other performances are incredibly engaging and well-executed. The Dinosaurs show is so realistic, it felt like we were witnessing actual prehistoric creatures! For children under 102cm, there are still plenty of opportunities to enjoy the shows from comfortable, stationary seating. Kid-Friendly Fun: My child absolutely adored the Minions and the meet-and-greet sessions. While the rides have height restrictions, the park offers a variety of shows and attractions suitable for younger children. Management and Amenities: The management of Universal Studios Singapore is truly commendable. Parking is well-organized, food options are diverse and delicious, and the park is impeccably clean. The overall organization and attention to detail are top-notch, making the entire experience seamless and enjoyable. The charges are fair for the level of entertainment provided.

Its raining so hard that you can ride a roller coaster even in the rain. Its amazing The environment is great and its a great experience. It would be better if it didnt rain. You can take a lot of photos to remember. The food in Universal Studios is also delicious. There are fast food restaurants and kopitiam as well as several restaurants with different flavors. There are also spaghetti space chase themed ice cream and cookies Its really delicious There is also a sweeping painter with a broom painting near the spaghetti space chase theme park, which is very special The prices in entertainment venues are not expensive either.

The Jurassic Park area was another highlight, with exciting attractions that were thrilling for both adults and children. Although some of the larger rides might have been a bit too intense for younger kids, there were plenty of milder attractions like the Madagascar ride, which was a great fit for our little one. What really stood out was how family-friendly the park is. There are many child-friendly facilities, including spacious baby changing rooms and stroller rentals, which made it so convenient for us as parents. The food options were diverse, catering to all tastes and dietary preferences.

After watching the show, my daughter, who loves Puss in Boots, was excited to take a photo with the characters.

As she approached the stage, a staff member unfairly stopped her, claiming she wasnt in the queue, despite her waiting the whole time. He didnt let us explain, acted rudely, and even prevented her from rejoining the queue, saying the photo session was over. This upset my daughter deeply, and it hurt us to see her first Universal Studios experience end with such a bad memory.

The entire park organization is also deficient in many areas. On a rainy day, the air conditioning runs so cold that it becomes uncomfortable to go indoors in wet clothes. The milkshakes are so cold that you're more likely to chew ice crystals. In terms of price/performance: The food is simply not worth the money. Especially for Singapore conditions. This was the worst meal of my entire trip so far. So, onto the good things: The decoration is really well done. The facades in the streets are lovingly and detailed. The best ride in my opinion was Revenge of the Mummy. Good storytelling. I can completely advise against Puss in Boots. This is an absolute stop and go ride with no flow. The park has real potential that it is wasting in so many places, so it's a real shame. I'm leaving again after about 3 hours.

The day I went was a weekday and it was raining lightly, but there were some stops. Some sunshine is considered very lucky. That's not hot at all. If it rains, choose to play in the shade. Or sit and watch a show When the sun came out, I took pictures of the beautiful light. Playing on outdoor playground equipment, very fun, very chill. You can bring food in. Because I was able to bring in snacks such as croissants, juice, fruit, and candy without being inspected much. As for water, if it feels heavy, you don't have to put it in. Because everywhere you go to play There will be free tap water to drink. There are lockers where you can leave your things for free for 45 minutes (some lockers are not free. You have to choose carefully) because some rides don't allow you to bring things in with you.

922,5,user_920,"A Memorable Day at Universal Studios Singapore A Must-Visit for Families! As an Indonesian tourist visiting Singapore with my family, we were beyond excited for our Universal Studios Singapore adventure and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! From the moment we stepped into the park, the sheer excitement of the iconic movie sets and themed areas took our breath away. First up, we hopped into the world of Sesame Street with the Spaghetti Space Chase. My kids couldn't stop laughing as we joined Elmo and his friends on a fun and quirky space adventure. It was such a fantastic start to the day, setting the tone for all the thrilling rides ahead! Next, we zoomed into action with The Transformers Ride. WOW! The special effects and 3D action made us feel like we were right in the middle of a battle between Autobots and Decepticons. My heart was racing, and my kids were cheering every time Optimus Prime appeared on screen. A must-ride for any action movie fan! Then, we braved the darkness of Revenge of the Mummy, and let me tell you, this rollercoaster is not for the faint of heart! The combination of high-speed twists, turns, and eerie effects had us gripping the safety bars and screaming in excitement. Its a perfect mix of thrills and scares! We then took a more relaxed ride on Dino-Soarin', where my younger ones loved flying around in their very own pterodactyl while we marveled at the giant animatronic dinosaurs. It was a gentle and fun ride to catch our breath before diving into more action-packed experiences. For a moment of laughter, we jumped into the world of Shrek 4D Adventure. The movie was hilarious, and the 4D effects like water sprays and seat movements made us feel like we were part of the story. A great family-friendly experience! The Carousel was next, and we all enjoyed riding the beautifully crafted animals. It was a simple but nostalgic moment where even the adults had fun going around and around. The Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure was the highlight of the day. If you're looking for thrills and chills, this is the ride for you! The water splashes, the sudden drops, and the Jurassic creatures that pop up around every corner kept us on edge and soaked by the end of it! As fans of the adorable cat, we couldn't miss Puss in Boots' Giant Journey. It was a fun, whimsical ride, full of color, excitement, and of course, Puss in Boots' signature charm. Perfect for the whole family to enjoy together! Lastly, we ended the day in the vibrant and exciting Minion Land. My kids were ecstatic to meet their favorite Minions, and we all loved the fun, interactive rides. The bright colors, lively atmosphere, and Minion-themed attractions were simply a delight. Now, while we had an unforgettable time, there was one ride that didnt quite live up to the excitement of the others The Treasure Hunters. It was a slower-paced ride, and honestly, we found it a bit boring compared to the other more thrilling and immersive experiences. But with so many other fantastic attractions, this one small blip didnt take away from the overall fun! In the end, Universal Studios Singapore gave us a day full of thrills, laughter, and unforgettable moments. From heart-pounding rides to family-friendly fun, its an experience that will stay with us long after weve left. Whether youre a thrill-seeker or just looking for a day of joy with your loved ones, this park is the perfect destination. We left with our hearts full of memories and a promise to return.

As the handle smells of a lot of sweat. Suggest to put a BIG sign to not bring phones or bags, otherwise the poor person at the front have to keep repeating himself or herself before scanning everyone with the handheld metal detector. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure: the ride itself is interesting and fun for my kid but the handles need maintenance work as well, it was sticky and slimy Shrek 4-D adventure: the show was good but i feel like more can be done to ensure that there is order. Lots of foreigns squeezing and pushing their way through to their desire seats even though we were queuing to enter the row already. Maybe ensure that there are lines on the floor for people to queue so that they go to the row that they are lining up for. We went for some other shows, which are generally good but overall as a local, I dont think i will not bring my kids or even think about going to USS again.

It's overpriced for the number and length of the rides and impossible to enjoy without the express pass. The rides themselves are mostly entertaining, but extremely short. The park was also quite well managed with enthusiastic staff to help at every turn. Speaking of the express pass. We purchased ours in advance expecting to be able to take all rides using it. Unfortunately, the freshly opened Minions section of the park required yet another upgraded express pass on arrival. Looking at the attractions in that section, we decided we'd spent enough at this park. In addition to that, transport to the island is completely inadequate for the number of visitors. Given the cost of any of the attractions, I don't expect to be shoved into a two-car monorail and covered in the sweat of others before I even arrive. This needs a serious upgrade. Take a quick look at the Disney parks in Hong Kong or Tokyo for inspiration. The rides to those parks are comfortable and inspire you to have fun with its decor. This one just feels like it's squeezing your wallet open by packing you into the train. On a final note, the food was some of the best we've had at a theme park.

Very colourful Minion Village, and I enjoyed my Minion Land Raspberry Ice Cream. At Buddie Boogie, you can dance, play, and take photos with the lovable Minion characters. It's a fantastic spot for kids and adults alike to let loose, have fun, and create unforgettable memories.

They simply gave u a choice to continue waiting INDEFINITELY or leave the queue. There was no service recovery at all. They should give visitors, at least the 1st 20 or so in the queue a food or express voucher. 2nd ride, the same thing happened AGAIN. This time, my group were supposed to be the next batch but there were technical difficulties too. While we were thankful that we weren't left hanging in the air like the batch before us, it was definitely very unpleasant. Again, there was no initiative for service recovery at all! I had to request for express tickets while explaining my situation of having about 2 hrs wasted in between these 2 rides. It's difficult to get the staff attention too. They avoided eye contact, walked away from me. They ALL were deemed bz 'helping' with the situation. Even though 1 or 2 was just looking 'bz'. An art which was frustrating to witness. There was another ride that was slightly delayed with technical issues again, but thankful, it was simply just a short 10min delay. Surprisingly, it wasn't crowded on a CNY Sunday afternoon.

1078,5,user_1075,"The first thing I would say is that you shouldn't bring expensive bags! I either put it in a locker when I get on a ride, or I put it on a shelf right before I get on a ride, and it's safe because it's safe, but everyone puts their Chanel bags on the shelf and rides... Well, I guess it's because it's safe that it's okay! ! I bought my ticket at Agoda the day before, and although there are buses available, I chose the monorail. I went to have breakfast at the mall near the monorail station! Meals in the park are park prices, but they are memorable so if you like them, go for it! It's hot, so if you don't want to buy drinks inside, I think it's better to bring some with you! It's a long time, from 10:00 to 20:00, but since many people stop by on the day they're heading back to the airport and leave early, it surprisingly starts to become empty in the evening. I was so excited that I decided to stay forever! Halfway through, the wait for the roller coaster series suddenly became 5 minutes, and I got carried away by riding the red Human (regular coaster), the black Cylon (twirl), and then I got drunk after twirling around Jurassic Park ( ;;) I rode most of the way, so I got home at 7pm. It's basically a small space, so I recommend checking the app to see if there are any open spaces. It was empty in the evening, so I skipped the 30 minute wait. There is no signboard that lets you see all the waiting times in the park, so you just have to look at the app. Most of the shoes I wear are foot bras, so if you don't want to have to take off your removable shoes every time you ride an attraction, I think sneakers are the way to go. Jurassic Park It's hot, so if it's empty, you should go first and get wet before walking around the park! You can bring your luggage with you, but there are lockers available for a fee. (Coaster-type trains do not force you to bring your luggage, so the coaster-type lockers are basically free. Japanese is OK. Please take your time and read carefully.) Some people brought raincoats or bought raincoats, but with a maximum of 9 people on board, there is a high possibility that 2 of them will get soaked! It's a gamble whether you use a kappa or not! ! I returned to the hotel with wet shoes, so I wish I had gotten on the train earlier. Jurassic leg bra guy Single is early! I got the best view of the scenery! Mommy It's early for singles, but I got lost on the way to the boarding area and was so scared that I almost cried.I hit it off with another child who also got lost and went to the boarding area together...When it's empty, I try not to get lost until I get to the boarding area (maybe it's just me). Personally, it's my favorite vehicle. Human Cylon It's not that scary, and the scenery isn't all that great. It's fun, but it's just a normal coaster. Shrek Zone coaster type I thought it was a trick for children, but it was surprisingly tall and scary! Visuals Donkey Shrek I'm not good at English, so I felt like I couldn't keep up with it... Shrek 4D is quite shaky, so please be careful with your children. (There are also seats that do not shake.) Sesame Street Super safe rides Water World If you don't want to get wet, please go to the back! (Surprisingly, if you look closely, there are empty seats.) I think it's more like the opening act before the show starts, so I think it's fun to go early, but I think some kids got scared because people were falling. Personally, if you don't mind, you should definitely see it! The one on fire there is a possibility of getting wet in the front row on the far right Impressed by the image in the back I've used the Single Rider several times, and every time I've been talked to, I've gotten a pack from a Korean girl I became friends with after getting lost at Mummy, a woman told me ""this is my first coaster ride in my life,"" a Chinese lady told me how beautiful the sky was, and I thought it was the most peaceful uni in the world. The vehicles and souvenirs are completely different from Los Angeles! It was so much fun! !

Most rides took around 10 minutes max with Express Pass, while the regular queue was easily 3045 minutes at best, and for some rides, even up to 2 hours. Puss in Boots with an Express Pass? Still took an hour, so yeah, be prepared. That being said, USS is still a fun experience. My top recommendations? Revenge of the Mummy (a great indoor coaster with cool effects), Transformers (always a solid choice), Human vs. Cyclon (for thrill-seekers), and Lights, Camera, Action! (surprisingly entertaining). If you like Jurassic Park, definitely check out Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (prepare to get soaked) and Canopy Flyer (a fun suspended coaster with a great view of the park). With the Express Pass, I managed to finish all the must-ride attractions by 3 PM, which made it feel worth it. If youre visiting on a peak day, just be prepared for long queues or consider getting an Express Passthough it doesnt always mean instant access. If you prefer a more relaxed experience, going on a weekday might be the way to go.",2/8/25,Public holiday,Up to 10 min,high_tolerance,47.52000000000001,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.9435,0.10500000000000001,0.4444444444444444,0.9583,0.0,0.0,0.9735,0.195,0.5719,0.198,0.0,0.9932,0,0,1,5,1.0,7,2,2,0.5045454545454545,0.95,1.0,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.10872289026744676,0.195,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.08333333333333333

Maybe it's because there are a lot of Chinese people in Malaysia, Singapore, and people of Chinese descent, so it seems like everyone is in a holiday festival mood... Perhaps because of that, there were breaks in the restaurant and there were many changes to the schedule. From the monorail waiting line to Sentosa Island... How long.. ah.. it was really hard. Visiting Universal Studios after several years.. Before that, I went to Japan, and this time to Singapore... It's okay to go to Singapore without an express ticket. I saw the post, there were so many people... The attraction with the shortest waiting time is 30 minutes. I thought there would be no answer if I waited like this. Express purchase available for one ride per attraction. 140 Singapore dollars per person.. 150,000 Korean Won.. Time is bought with money.... This was my first experience purchasing an express ticket. Since the waiting time for popular attractions is 80 to 100 minutes, I couldn't find an answer. There were places where I had to wait 30 minutes for the express line, and anyway, I rode everything I could. Legal cutting in line...Express... I came this far to get on one, but I was so mad at waiting for an hour or two... In the end, I think I did well anyway... Because it's less difficult for my family... Above all, a child who likes to ride amusement rides Proving once again that laughter is worth the money.

It is smaller than in California, but the best shows such as Waterworld are also available here. It's always crowded. I recommend getting a fast pass. You'll wait much less time at activities. Especially children get bored while waiting. Fast pass provides an advantage. Rollercosters are a lot of fun. The adrenaline level of the black one is very high. We went in the afternoon. The fast pass was sufficient for all activities from 2 o'clock until closing. If you want to travel comfortably, relax and do the activities we love over and over again, go in the morning.

1469,5,user_1465,We visited Universal Studios on New Year's Day. We were advised to book tickets in advance and to also book express line pass tickets. We did book our tickets in advance but didn't add the express. We waited until we arrived to see how busy the park was. Luckily the park was not as busy as normal. We were able to enter the park without any wait. The longest queue time we waited in was for 40mins. The rest of the rides were 25mins or less. If the park is busy maybe consider the express tickets but these are costly. Wait to see if the park is busy as you could end up wasting money. The rides were great and each section was designed and built very well. Our son had an amazing time here.

I love the Ancient Egypt and Sci-fi sections, the Spaghetti Chase and puss in boots are all awesome. Canopy flyer is way to short and the cue can be up to a 120 minute wait and I miss the Madagascar ride. It would be nice to have a How to train your dragon ride- something like Disneys Soarin. All it has is a Merch shop and a statue of Toothless. There isnt a Harry Potter world or Jaws ride, no Fast and Furious. Basically it needs more rides to ease the wait times.

I recently visited the park and went to Mels Diner and I told the server that I would like a burger but cant eat wheat or gluten, I even explained it in Malay and my burger came with a slice of meat with cheese stuck to the paper, sauce everywhere and very little lettuce ( a lettuce wrap would have fixed it), the whole thing was a disaster and messy.

All loose belongings and bags have to be left in a locker outside the ride or with someone not riding.

The prices vs quality of food was as expected at an amusement park. Expensive and not the best. Also that restaurants are automatically adding 10% tips... well thats not how tips is supposed to be. Its just a nasty way to mark up all prices by 10%. If you think popcorn is expensive at the movie theatre. Then do not even think about buying it here. 10 bucks for a tiny thing that is filled to 75% because the top is supposed to be able to be folded and closed... well thats a rip off too.

Even some parts of the meandering queues to indoor rides like the Accelerator, are outside the shelter. And if thunder roars, be prepared to kiss your outdoor rides goodbye, as these would be suspended for your safety. Also, avoid visiting the park during peak period, eg the school holidays and festive seasons. It is so overcrowded that it would take you almost a full day (or about 8 hours) just to enjoy 4 (or if you are lucky, 5) rides, with each ride lasting for less than 5 mins on average. Because most of the time would be spent on queuing and waiting for these rides. The same applies to dining at USS and taking the Sentosa Express.

1637,1,user_1632,"Disappointing Experience at Universal Studios We visited Universal Studios recently and left feeling disappointed. While we were excited for a fun family day, the experience fell short for several reasons: 1. Overpriced: The ticket prices are extremely high, and once inside, additional expenses like food, drinks, and souvenirs add up quickly. It's hard to justify the cost for what you get in return. 2. Not Family-Friendly: Many rides have height or age restrictions, making them inaccessible for small kids. For a family with younger children, there wasnt much to do apart from walking around or waiting for shows. 3. Excessive Waiting Times: The waiting times for each ride were unreasonably longsome lines stretched to over an hour or two. Spending most of the day standing in line wasnt the enjoyable experience we had hoped for. 4. Underwhelming Shows: The shows were lackluster and didnt make up for the long waits and limited ride options. They seemed more like fillers rather than highlights of the park. Overall, the park feels overpriced and poorly managed when it comes to accommodating families. We wouldnt recommend it unless youre willing to spend a lot of money and time for very little in return.

From the moment I entered, I was greeted by the iconic spinning globe, making me think, 'Is this a rotating globe using a machine, or is it being blown by the Singaporean wind?' Riding Transformers: The Ride, I immediately felt like I was filming a Hollywood film. Screaming while avoiding evil robots, even though he was just sitting on a chair. Then try Battlestar Galactica, only then will you know what it's like to be thrown around by fate like laundry in a laundry machine. Favorite part? Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. I pretended to be calm, until the dinosaur appeared and the water splashed in my face. Immediately soaked, but happy at heart. Oh, and don't forget to take photos with the Minions, OK!

From the moment I walked into the Dark Room to retrieve my photos, Iskandar went above and beyond to ensure I had a wonderful experience. One of the photos I had taken earlier in the day didnt turn out as nice as I had hoped, and without hesitation, Iskandar kindly offered to help me retake it. He was incredibly patient and meticulous, putting in extra effort to ensure the new photo was perfect. His dedication to ensuring I wouldnt leave with a less-than-stellar memento was genuinely heartwarming. Its rare to encounter someone so committed to delivering top-notch service, and Iskandars attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile truly made my day.

The Battlestar Galactica roller coasters, both Human and Cylon, were pure adrenaline rushesfast, intense, and unforgettable. The Transformers 3D Ride was another standout, immersing us in a thrilling battle with incredible visuals and effects that made us feel like we were part of the action. For fans of Jurassic Park, the Water Rapids Adventure was a perfect mix of excitement and splashes. We also couldnt resist the charm of the Revenge of the Mummy, a dark, high-speed indoor coaster with a spooky yet fun vibe. Even the gentler rides, like Madagascar: A Crate Adventure, had us smiling ear to ear with their attention to detail and charm. The park itself is wonderfully designed, with each themed zonefrom Ancient Egypt to Hollywoodtransporting you to another world. The food options were diverse and delicious, and we appreciated the shaded areas and water fountains to stay cool in the tropical heat. The staff were friendly and efficient, ensuring that queues moved smoothly and adding to the overall positive vibe.

I would recommend people who are fit and are capable of standing in long queues and having the fitness to do long walks visit this place. The reason is that the wait time can go up to 90 minutes per ride hence it becomes difficult to continuously stand in a queue. People who are older in age or have physical movement issues should refrain from taking rides. The place has many rides with many of them having high speed roller coasters. Many of the movies in 4D are also good with real simulation, which can become scary as well. The theme park has in house shopping where you can buy souvenirs accordingly. Please keep your tickets safe as it is very important to roam freely inside the park. Many food stalls are present and along with that many restaurants are present to have a good meal.

Unfortunately, I booked our tickets through a sponsored link on Headout, unaware of the complexities involved. The ticketing process was confusing; in the past, there used to be one entrance ticket for the whole day entry, but now there are separate day and night passes. Misled by Headout's website, we unknowingly purchased day passes instead of night passes, spending 366 with express passes included for 2 persons only. When we arrived at the entrance, we hoped the staff would be understanding and allow us to switch to night passes with a willingness to pay the difference. However, we were denied entry with no flexibility shown. It felt unnecessarily harsh, especially since we had already paid for entry and the company had profited from it. The refusal to accommodate or show empathy was deeply disappointing. We were told to buy new tickets if we wanted to enterwe were reluctant to spend a total of 600-800 for just a few hours at a small and overcrowded theme park. In the end, we left and spent the money at VivoCity on some nice shoes instead.

1925,5,user_1918,"Universal Studios Singapore is a world class theme park located on Sentosa Island Singapore, offering a thrilling mix of rides, attractions, and shows based on popular movies and TV shows. Its the first Universal Studios theme park in Southeast Asia and having seven themed zones, including Hollywood, New York, and Jurassic Park, each immersing visitors into the magic of cinema. When I visited about a year ago, I had an incredible time exploring the park. The highlight for me was definitely the extreme rides like the Battlestar Galactica rollercoaster and the Transformers 3D experience. The live shows, such as the Water world stunt show, were also fantastic, providing some great moments of excitement and humour. I really appreciated the immersive theming in each zone, and the parks attention to detail in food and merchandise added an extra layer of enjoyment. However, one downside I noticed was that the park can get quite crowded, especially during the weekend and the prices there for food and drinks is quite expensive, like a single water bottle there cost 4 Singaporean Dollar but the food was nice though like the churros i got. Wait times for some of the popular rides were longer than expected, and the park felt a bit cramped in certain areas. While the attractions are great, a few could use some updates or new features to keep things even more cool :). Despite these drawbacks, if you enjoy theme parks and can visit during weekday, I would definitely recommend Universal Studios Singapore.

Other than these there are many options in the pyramid that is the Egypt segment or the Sci-Fi segment I would recommend everyone to watch them. There are various segments with heater is I personally 8 and patriot Jurassic world overall there are 7-8 restaurants. There are other food stalls and drink stalls as well. There are numerous stalls where mementos are available with the sticker of the logo of universal studios those things are dam costly I mean food be interested in buying a minion 6 to 7 inches soft toy with a price tag of around 30 US dollars!!! Not me. But the design of the whole amusement park is amazing and with just a single ticket you can virtually spend the whole day with your family.

Many giftshops around so many souvenirs available. Please don't bring young kids onto rollercoaster rides like transformers or mummy they keep crying summore its a literal drop rollercoaster.

The queues are long. My entire family was flabbergasted and almost vomited. Vigorous spinning, dropping and speeding up. Do not recommend for young kids and weak people, older kids maybe can lah based on if they are ok with it 2. Transformers 4d movie. It was also rollercoaster with spinning and speeding up, its kinda nice but queue is long 3. Seasame street spaghetti space chase. Great for seniors and younger children but no thrill at all it's so slow 4. Raptor rapids. My favourite ride so far. Guy at entrance was funny. The ride itself was exciting and there was a drop at the end. Others clothes were all soaked but only my converse was drenched. I thought the trex would spray water at us 5. Trolls hug time jubilee. Relaxing and fun for young families with bubbles and confetti. 6. Waterworld show. It was quite funny and exciting but not rlly for young kids becoz got gunfire, fireworks, fire and explosions.

Even if the Madagascar area that we went to back in 2011 was no longer there, as it was being replaced by Minions Land that will open in 2025. We also had our meal at USS due to lunch hour being at the halfway mark of our visit (we entered the park at 1005 hrs when it just opened) and what better place than the main F&B outlet that looks just like the one in the Jurassic Park movies? The meals were a bit on the pricey side but the large replica T-Rex in the center of the building was good eye candy though! However, two things did spoil the experience slightly: firstly, the queues were insane, ranging from 30 to 50 minutes so we should get the express pass in future and secondly, it was really hot and humid on the day we were at USS, but luckily we brought our own bottles and there were lots of convenient water fountains all over the park too.",10/30/24,Weekday,3060 min,high_tolerance,55.0,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.743,0.052000000000000005,0.3333333333333333,0.9245,0.0,0.0,0.8402,0.137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9323,1,0,0,45,0.5,7,3,5,0.38999999999999996,1.0,1.0,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.1625011175488333,0.092,1.0,0.0,0.375

Once the Minion area opens, I guess guestflows will be better. It rubbed me the wrong way that they heavily advertise their Express pass service. Every 100 or so meters there was an employee waiving around with a banner about this. The River Adventure ride was closed for maintenance, which wasn't advertised during booking, on the app or on the website. A huge let down, because the amount of big rides is already quite limited. We arrived at 10 sharp and managed to complete the big 7 rides by 11. When we walked back towards the entrance the queues really started to built up there. So; arrive early. Start at Transformers, then work your way towards the Shrek area. At certain times the music/entertainment was blasting out very loudly. In combination with the high amount of guests, sometimea very narrow paths that were obstructes by themeing, this created a rather unpleasant and chaotic environment. 60 Eur admission seemed fair to us.

2133,5,user_2124,"We recently visited Universal Studios Singapore, and it was an exhilarating experience from start to finish! Nestled within the Resorts World Sentosa, this theme park offers an impressive array of attractions, shows, and dining options that cater to visitors of all ages. As soon as I entered the park, I was struck by the vibrant atmosphere and the detailed theming of each zone. From the futuristic landscapes of Sci-Fi City to the enchanting streets of Far Far Away, every area is beautifully designed and immersive. The iconic Hollywood Boulevard sets the stage perfectly with its charming shops and street performances. One of the highlights of my visit was the rides. The **Transformers: The Ride** was a standout, combining cutting-edge technology with thrilling action that left me breathless. The **Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure** was another favorite, offering both excitement and a chance to cool off from the Singapore heat. For those seeking a more family-friendly experience, the **Shrek 4-D Adventure** was delightful, filled with humor and engaging visuals. The live shows were equally impressive. The **WaterWorld** stunt show was a thrilling spectacle with jaw-dropping stunts and pyrotechnics that captivated the audience. Its a must-see for anyone visiting the park! Dining options are plentiful, with various cuisines available. I enjoyed a delicious meal at Mel's Drive-In, which offered classic American fare in a retro setting. While the food was tasty, prices were a bit on the higher side, which is typical for theme parks. One thing to keep in mind is that the park can get quite crowded, especially on weekends and holidays. I recommend arriving early and considering an Express Pass to make the most of your day without long wait times. Overall, Universal Studios Singapore is a fantastic destination filled with fun, adventure, and unforgettable experiences. Whether youre a thrill-seeker or just looking to enjoy a day of entertainment, its a great choice. I left with wonderful memories and cant wait to return!

That might have even been the reason the queues were so long, cause people with a fast track pass kept being let through. It's very pay to win. However the park is pretty but very small.

2172,5,user_2162,"Universal Studios is a must-see if you are visiting Singapore. If you enjoy movie-themed rides, roller coasters, cartoon mascots, and all things silly and wonderful, this is the place for you! You cannot see everything in one day, so try to arrive as early as possible. However, here are a few tips: 1. Get an Express Pass or you will spend the majority of the day lining up for rides.

2185,4,user_2175,"Having visited Universal Studios Singapore several times before, I recently returned after a long hiatus, eager to see how it had evolved. Unfortunately, my recent experience wasn't ideal. Despite purchasing tickets weeks in advance, the park was extremely crowded. While I expected lines for the rides, the wait times were excessive. We queued for the Cyclone roller coaster for over two and a half hours, only to be met with an announcement of an indefinite delay. This, coupled with the intense heat, led us to abandon the queue, a decision shared by many others. We did manage to experience two other rides, but each came with a wait time of at least an hour. The congestion was pervasive, impacting even the express lines. It felt as though the park had overreached its capacity, diminishing the overall experience. Perhaps implementing a queuing limit or a reservation system for popular rides would alleviate this issue. Compared to other Universal Studios parks, such as those in Japan or Orlando, Singapore's offering feels smaller and less engaging. While it may be a suitable option for those with budget constraints or limited travel opportunities, especially within Southeast Asia, I would recommend exploring other Universal Studios parks for a more fulfilling experience. It's worth noting that I visited during peak season (Indonesia's holiday, causing influx of visits in Singapore) which undoubtedly contributed to the extensive wait times. A friend who visited recently during the off-season reported significantly shorter queues. While longer waits are expected during peak periods, the park should consider implementing measures to improve the queuing system and overall guest experience during these busy times.",10/15/24,Weekday,1 hr,critical_tolerance,70.0,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.9517,0.095,0.6,0.9723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.167,0.3,0.9723,1,0,0,60,0.5,0,1,3,0.075,0.3,0.6666666666666666,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.020690968891494715,0.107,0.5,0.0,0.5

We all had fun until my mom got on Revenge of the Mummy. It was my mistake that my mom let to ride on because she barely can ride any rides since she has vestibular neuritis I just didn't think of this fact until we got on the ride. Revenge of the Mummy isn't really scary but for my mom it was; it drops down and turns with high speed and as a result, her condition got bad; vestibular neuritis has attacked her again. This does come around her once or twice a year so I felt very sorry for my mom that I didn't take care of her enough. We had to ask for a help to one of a staff and he called a manager and she helped us all the way to get my mom takes enough rest. Thank you so much, Alexis and to all staff who cared and helped us! The place where my mom took a rest was near the entrance so we had to walk all the way back. Since my mom was having difficulties walking by herself even we give our hands to her so, Alexis prepared a wheelchair, she tried to help my mom being cool by blocking strong sunlight and hot humid weather while we were walking down the road. We could feel that Alexis really did concern my mom sincerely and she tried her best to help us out.

Go inside on the opening time. The rides are enough to keep you engaged whole day. On weekend 40 mins wait is standard time. Food and juices are available inside. Roller coasters have most wait times. Prayer room is also available. There can be combos offered but I think only separate dedicated trip is recommended. To reach monorail from Vivo center is most convenient way which cost 4/5 Singapore dollar. Transformers was acclaimed to be worth watching in 4d etc but after few days I found 6d experience at genting Highland which was far better.

2330,1,user_2319,"Having been to Florida a few times I was excited to visit Universal Singapore however that initial excitement quickly disappeared when I saw the queue for the first ride Cyclon (battlestar galactic rollercoaster) which was 90 minutes. First off they are militant about not having your phone or any bag on you and check prior to entering the queue meaning you can't even try and plan your day whilst waiting. And also basically no ride set up and amusement when waiting in line makes for a rather long and boring wait. Even the 1st class citizens who pay more than the price of the park ticket again to get the 'priority pass' had to wait about 30 minutes for the ride. Absolutely detest this scummy system parks seem to use but it seems to be standard and not normally too much of an issue if regular queue times are reasonable and rides have single rides options (of which I only seen this option for the transformer 4d coaster at Singapore universal) Eventually we managed to get on the coaster and it was pretty mid, the hulk or velocicoaster from Florida this is not. Anyway this set the scene for the rest of the day. Huge lines for pretty much all rides / shows and pretty average when you actually got to experience it. Also this was a Monday so I don't know if that makes a difference but I wouldn't want to see this park on a busy weekend. The water world show was ok. Probably the best thing there... And actually managed to see it without a massive wait which was a bonus. Overall I would avoid this park, it would make for an ok day out if they let about half of the people in on a daily basis but that would not line their coffers I guess....",9/17/24,Weekday,1 hr,tolerance_collapse,50.0,dissatisfied,time_sensitive,0.9581,0.062,0.5333333333333333,0.983,0.0,0.0,0.5719,0.08900000000000001,0.0,-0.046,0.0,0.983,1,0,0,60,0.5,1,1,3,0.34,0.9,1.0,0,0.07693508114856429,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0243222074037784,0.103,0.5,0.0,0.5

2390,3,user_2378,"Universal Studios Singapore is one of the top attractions on Sentosa Island, offering a fun-filled day of thrilling rides, entertaining shows, and a dose of Hollywood magic. I visited Universal Studios in September, and while the experience was enjoyable overall, there were a few downsides that made the day less smooth than expected. The first thing to note is that it was *extremely hot* when we visited. Singapores tropical climate is hot and humid year-round, and being out in the sun all day can take a toll. I would highly recommend bringing a hat, plenty of sunscreen, and staying hydrated, as there is limited shade in some areas of the park. Despite the heat, the excitement of the park and the energy of the visitors kept the mood upbeat. One of the biggest drawbacks of our visit was the *long queues*. Universal Studios Singapore is a very popular destination, especially on weekends and holidays, which means waiting times for rides can easily exceed 45 minutes to an hour. The popular attractions like *Transformers: The Ride* and *Revenge of the Mummy* had some of the longest lines, and waiting under the sun only added to the discomfort. If youre not a fan of waiting or dont want to spend the majority of your day standing in line, I highly recommend upgrading to a *VIP pass or Express membership*. These passes allow you to skip the regular queues, saving you a lot of time and ensuring you can experience more rides without the frustration of long waits. Its definitely a splurge, but I found it to be worth it if you want to maximize your time and avoid the heat. As for the rides themselves, Universal Studios offers a variety of experiences, but if youre a thrill-seeker, you may find some of them underwhelming compared to other parks like *Ferrari World* in Abu Dhabi. For example, while the *Battlestar Galactica* roller coasters are exciting, they don't compare to the intense thrills of Ferrari Worlds *Formula Rossa*the fastest roller coaster in the world. Universal Studios rides are more family-friendly and are designed to cater to all age groups, which means the thrill level is a bit toned down compared to parks focused on extreme rides. That said, there are still a few standout attractions that are well worth trying. *Transformers: The Ride* is an amazing 3D experience that fully immerses you in the world of the Autobots and Decepticons. The visual effects and motion simulation are incredibly well done, and it was one of the highlights of my visit. *Revenge of the Mummy* is another great ride, blending dark indoor roller coaster elements with special effects and surprises. These rides offer unique experiences that you won't find in many other parks, making them worth the wait, even if the queues are long. In addition to the rides, Universal Studios Singapore offers plenty of entertainment with live shows and character meet-and-greets. However, the shows also tend to attract large crowds, so it's best to plan your day carefully to catch them without missing out on too many rides. **Conclusion:** Universal Studios Singapore is a fun park with a good mix of rides, shows, and Hollywood-themed attractions, but there are a few things to keep in mind before visiting. The heat can be intense, so come prepared, and the long queues can be frustrating. If you want to make the most of your day, I highly recommend opting for a VIP pass or Express membership to skip the lines. While the rides here are more family-friendly and not as intense as those in Ferrari World, they still offer a unique and enjoyable experience.

It is filled with filmy entertainment, rides that give you adrenaline rush, truly fun activities for kids. Perfect for a day having fun with family and friends, this theme park has something special for everyone. The park is divided into various themed zones, each transporting you into a different cinematic universe. From the glitzy streets of Hollywood to the futuristic landscapes of Sci-Fi City, the attention to detail is impeccable. Walking through these zones feels like stepping into the movies themselves. The vibrant colors, iconic landmarks, and thematic music all contribute to an immersive atmosphere that captivates visitors from the moment they step in. It offers a wide variety of rides that cater to different age groups and thrill levels. The twists, turns, and inversions deliver an adrenaline rush that is hard to match. The Transformers: The Ride is an absolute highlight. This 3D dark ride combines cutting-edge technology with immersive storytelling to create an exhilarating experience that leaves you on the edge of your seat. For families with younger children, the Madagascar: A Crate Adventure boat ride and Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase offer fun and excitement without being too intense. These rides are beautifully designed with vibrant characters and engaging storylines, making them enjoyable for both kids and adults. The live shows at Universal Studios Singapore are not to be missed. The WaterWorld show, in particular, is a spectacular performance filled with high-octane stunts, pyrotechnics, and special effects. The cast is incredibly talented, and the show is packed with action from start to finish. Its a thrilling experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In addition to the shows, the character meet-and-greets are a big hit, especially with the younger visitors. Meeting iconic characters like Shrek, the Minions, and the cast of Madagascar adds an extra layer of magic to the day. The food options within the park are diverse, catering to various tastes and dietary preferences. Whether youre in the mood for a quick snack or a sit-down meal, theres something for everyone. The themed restaurants, not only serve delicious food but also add to the overall immersive experience. Prices are what youd expect in a theme park, but the quality and variety make it worth it. The staff at Universal Studios Singapore are friendly, helpful, and go out of their way to ensure that visitors have a smooth and enjoyable experience. Even on busy days, they manage the crowds efficiently, and the queues for rides move at a reasonable pace. Tips: Get there early to utilise full day and enjoy all attractions. The Express Pass can be a good investment on busier days, helping you skip the lines and enjoy more attractions. Dont forget to bring sunscreen, as much of the park is outdoors. Also, bring a pair of fresh clothes if youre planning on enjoying all water rides or buy ponchos from nearby stores in the park to protect yourself from getting wet. Most likely you will which is another kind of fun. A fresh pair of clothes will come in handy in these situations or if it rains.",9/4/24,Weekday,Up to 10 min,high_tolerance,31.68,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.92,0.293,0.06451612903225806,0.8402,0.0,0.0,0.9417,0.212,0.0,0.121,0.0,0.9985,1,0,0,5,0.5,5,8,10,0.2434782608695652,0.8,1.0,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.02096107661566375,0.196,0.5,0.0,0.041666666666666664

It was a low-key experience to see such kind of management at a place like this.

The waiting time is often long here. 6. Far Far Away: This area is based on the characters and their worlds from animated films, such as Shrek and Madagascar. 7. Madagascar: This themed area is inspired by the Madagascar film series and features family-friendly rides and attractions. The swings here are very entertaining and thrilling.

Usually when we visit USS, it is also a staycation in RWS, and so we will usually exit during lunch time, maybe go back to the room to rest and escape from the afternoon sun and come back again after 3pm. No re-entry means lunch was inside USS. As it is the school holidays, the place is quite crowded and due to the rain, everyone was indoors. As a gauge, a burger and fries set is 17 and a corn dog is 7, and a scope of ice cream is 7. 2. Universal express pass is limited. If you do not wish to wait in queue for rides (as a gauge, Rapid dash was 50 mins queue, transformer ride was 60 mins and Puss-in-boots ride was 40 mins wait), the express pass is an option. It cost about 90 for a person, but from the beginning of the year, they no longer offer unlimited express pass. The express pass can only be used once at every attraction. For example if you are not intending to use the pass for the enchanted airways ride, it cannot be used for a 2nd express ride for transformer ride.

2547,5,user_2535,"My fourth time at Universal Studios and it's still one of the best experiences Singapore has to offer. Took my 15 year old and 11 year old. Some key points: To make the the most of your day, you gotta get Universal Express. Trust me, some queues get up to a 90-minute wait. It's steep but worth it. The Universal Express Pass works only once per ride. So best to plan your day before heading to Sentosa (where Universal Studios is). If you're there as soon as gates open at 10am, you could get the first two rides without any queues to worry about, so you save your Universal Express Pass to return to those rides and jump the queue when the wait times are over 40 minutes. I recommend getting in at 10am and going straight to Battlestar Galactica Human and Battlestar Galactica Cylon using regular queue. These rides are really good and you're gonna wanna do these again. By the time you're done with the first two rides, the queues would be getting longer so you can now use your Express Pass for the rest of the day (and be sure to return to those first two rides and enjoy the quick Universal Express access). The best rides for me are Battlestar Galactica: Cylon, Battlestar Galactica: Human, Transformers The Ride and the Mummy Ride. Jurassic Park is good too, but best to do that at the end of your day because you will get wet even with the silly little plastic coat thing they sell there. The Waterworld show is also quite good. There are heaps on eating options at Universal Studios. I didn't like the corn dogs but the hot dogs near Jurassic Park were fantastic. I highly recommend it. The Thai Basil hotdog is divine and the staff member there - Yusri, was great. Staff wise: it's a bit of a mixed bag. Some rude attendants are polite and fun. Others are robotic and often not in the best of moods. Getting there is quite easy. Beware of a bit of surge pricing when taking a taxi from Sentosa to return to your hotel.

2554,3,user_2542,"Having been at universal in Orlando and many other theme parks I found this one quite mid. It was super packed, so each line was a minimum of 50 minutes without the fast pass. If you buy tickets online you get a voucher for shopping and food, 5Sgd voucher for each. Use the food one before 7:30 pm or it becomes invalid. The single rider lanes appear to be closed but you need to ask to go through. Some of them are actually closed tho, not sure why. The best ride is the cylon, the only rollercoaster that can set some emotion. The Battlestar galactica red one was totally not worth it. Better to ride cylon twice. Super disappointed on galactica it was slow you could have a conversation whilst on it. Also the single ride was closed for it... The water show was cool tho, probably one of the best things at the park and different to the other parks. The items at the stores are surprisingly cheap compared to Disney and universal Orlando. I bought a character mug for 5 euro. Using my voucher. You can bring in food if you want, and water bottles as there are many stations to fill up your water. For the long waits in the line there are rollercoasters where you have to put your belongings in a locker before lining up, so plan ahead and think of some games to play or bring some head up or something.

2602,5,user_2590,"So I share my experience. Also thanks to Baron for his advice. This will be long, sorry. Maybe it will be useful to someone. Today (Monday) we went to Universal Park. We bought tickets in advance for the trip. We got to HarbourFront station, where we took the escalator 2 times up the shopping center. We went out to where the snowman was standing. Then take a stroll along the promenade towards Sentosa and signs for universal. The walk is probably 20 minutes. We were at the entrance at 9.10, there was already a queue of 12 people (4-5 groups) standing (or rather sitting). There are several queues in the line, you can join any one. Periodically, they open a new one and everyone runs there. You can stand so that the next one is closed and there is no longer a queue; closer to 9:40 it will open and you will be even closer. We actually became the first. They do everything for the people. They check everyone's tickets and ask them to prepare them in advance so that there is no confusion at the entrance. They opened around 9:50. We immediately started on Transformers and were the first there. Generally the first. A fun attraction, but not as they say in the reviews, that this is the best thing you will see. Well maybe for me.. Then straight to the Mummy, we stood in line for 5 minutes. Already a fun attraction. Maybe if we still understand what they are saying (maybe they are scaring us with something?), we just stared. Then straight to Jurassic Park, in line for about 5 minutes. Of course, its better to wear a raincoat, but it depends on your luck. I was wearing it, but still at least squeeze out my panties. As a result, we went through the main attractions before 10.30, maybe earlier, and without any queues at all. The slides didn't interest us and then they were closed for some reason. Afterwards we went to see Shrek in 4D, there wasnt much of a queue since the hall was large. The main thing is to take at least some place. I liked this, although I didnt expect anything. I thought it was cooler than the top ones. A cool cartoon with 3Deffects. Having rested a bit, we went to the Stunt Show. The biggest disadvantage here is that there is also a queue, but everyone will be seated. There is a lot of space. The hall is divided into 3 row zones. Zone 1 will definitely get wet (not even because of the show, but just before the show the warm-up gets everyone wet), the second one might get wet, zone 3 stay dry. Funny show, the plane is spectacular. Since the minimum plan had been fulfilled, we then simply walked and came in one by one. In the middle of the day there were a lot of people. The waiting time is written next to each attraction; for transformers it was written 120 minutes. But here's an example. On the hill near Shrek's castle, the waiting time was 60 minutes, we got through in 25 (I timed it), Sesame says 50 minutes, but we got through in 12. It depends on your luck. Since you won't realize it in advance, the line inside the building may meander. Total: everything is absolutely real, theres no need for express (you need it if you sleep until 12 and go during rush hour. But here the choice is yours. Dont sleep or pay). Drinking fountains are everywhere, you can get water. The park is not big, from edge to edge it takes 10-15 minutes.

2612,5,user_2600,"Attention !!! Buy Express pass or go single - This place is Not recommended for family with kids below 4 years !!! My strong advise is to buy Express pass to avoid really really really long queues which may go from 60 mins upto 120 minutes in a intense humid day. Most rides are prioritised for Express pass holder which is really frustrating to wait and see them passing quickly and standard ticket holders being neglected and delayed almost in some rides. Pls be mindful that most of the big attractions are not for children below 4 years (height wise) so I dont recommend really to go with kids of that age as apart from gift shops, there is nothing really for them. For adults better buy a Express pass (allowed once per ride) or go alone in ""Single"" queue (incase allowed) as most of the time single queue is closed. One day is enough if u reach at 10am and come out at closing time. Overall the place is obviously great to be at. Rides to go for... 1. Jurassic Park Boat Ride 2. Revenge of Mummy Ride 3.

2631,5,user_2619,"There's a catch in my 5* grade. I bought rise and dine early acces which allowed my and my two kids to enter the park at 8am, 2 hours before the regular crowd, with a free breakfast in Mel's Diner. Otherwise, it would be a ruined day with regular tickets because the queues are huge during the day. Although only 3 attractions were included in the early acces, here's why is this premium buy for a small extra fee. 1. You get to enter the park among the first, we litterary entered first (we came at 7.45 in the queue and we entered the park at 7.55). We were running to be alone on the streets and had a chance to take some really nice photos without any people around (which is impossible later). 2. We didn't want to go to the special effects show, but we run for the Transformers ride, which is absolutely great. We came there first and we had 4 consecutive rides without any waiting in the queues (for the last we waited 5 minutes). During the day the queue for this ride is 2 hours. We also checked Sesame Street ride and it's for the small kids, you can skip that. 3. It's very important to get to the free breakfast around 9.00 because you have to wait around 20-25 minutes to get your order (it's very good breakfast). I am saying this because you have to be ready by 9.45 when they let early access visitors to go to the rest of the park. That means you will be among the first for all the other rides, including rollercoasters, Jurassic Park rides or the Mummy (we skipped it in the morning since the queues are really small after 2pm and we did 4 consecutive rides in the aftrenoon). From that point at 9.45 you will have at least 90 minutes to try everything you want without big queues. After 11 or 11.30 am, the queues are staring to be unbearable. 4. Since you checked all the rides you wanted, some even few times, you can now slow down and enjoy the park, visit the stores, get yourself a cup of coffee or see one of the shows. In the afternoon you can go for the Mummy ride (it is brilliant) and maybe wait for another one or two other rides if you want. Without this early access I would probably go mad waiting in the lines for hours for a couple of minutes ride.

It is better to enter the park at the opening time so you can experience almost all the rides there. Its better to take the tickets in advance and can avoid the long queue especially in the weekends. The fast track tickets are available, it will help to skip the long queue in rides. But we have to pay double the cost for normal, I think it worths. Otherwise it will take two or three days to complete experiencing all rides and activities. Never miss the roller coaster rides. In rainy weather they will stop most of the rides including roller coaster. Mobile phones are strictly not allowed in roller coaster. And they close at 6.00pm, its a very short time period for this mega adventure park. I strongly suggest to the management of Universal Studios to extend the time for closing to at least up to 07.30 pm. Anyway the time spend in this place is amazing, kids are really enjoying it.

The waiting at the opening gate was usually crowded, especially during the Holidays or weekend on peak season, but rest assured that the lines are moving very quickly and to save more time, I suggest you buy the ticket online (I used Klook). The line to any attractions is quite long though, so if you want to save some times, you can buy the Universal Express Pass. The attractions, went through almost every one of them and enjoy it so much. The staffs are also very courteous, saw a few people trying to cut the line but the staffs handled it very professionally so kudos to them.

2965,4,user_2952,"**Universal Studios Singapore: A Thrilling Experience with a Few Hiccups** As an avid theme park enthusiast, I recently visited Universal Studios Singapore. While the overall experience was exhilarating, there were a couple of issues that prevented me from giving it a perfect 5-star rating. **What I Loved:** 1. **Rides and Attractions:** The rides are top-notch, especially Battlestar Galactica and Revenge of the Mummy. The attention to detail in each themed area is commendable. 2. **Immersive Worlds:** Walking through Hollywood, Ancient Egypt, and Far Far Away felt like stepping into beloved movies. The ambiance is captivating. 3. **Shows and Performances:** The WaterWorld show and the street performances added an extra layer of entertainment. Kudos to the talented performers! **Areas for Improvement:** 1. **Queue Times:** You hit the nail on the head here. The queue times displayed often didn't match the actual wait. Waiting for 20 minutes turned into a 2-hour ordeal. 2. **Seating:** Agreed! Some queue lines lacked seating areas. Standing for hours can be exhausting, especially in the tropical heat. **Tips for Fellow Visitors:** - **Early Bird Advantage:** Arrive early to beat the crowds and enjoy shorter wait times. - **Hydrate and Rest:** Bring water and take short breaks. Your feet will thank you! - **Patience Is Key:** Remember, everyone's there for the same reasonto have a blast!

The day we came, it was S110, but can go as low as S80. Lines for rides that would normally be 80 minutes, you can get on in 20 minutes with an express pass. I do believe you can buy an express pass online when you buy your ticket, however I bought once inside. The transformers ride is definitely worth it, low wait times for me and a really exciting ride. The Cylon roller coaster was also really good, as was the mummy indoor roller coaster, however these have much longer wait times. Food is VERY expensive there, but tastes pretty good. I arrived there by bus, which is only S1, but you can also get there through cable car and monorail. I recommend getting a locker and splitting cost among friends, as you can't bring possessions on most roller coasters. I also recommend spending at least 6 or 7 hours there, there's that much to do.

Waiting time was less during opening time period and after 5pm. Even though we had to wait 60-70min during day time, after than 5pm, there was only 5-15min. I thought whether to buy express ticket, on the day we visited, even it was LNY peak period, riding attractions was enough to enjoy without the express ticket. ** revisited in July, and it was crowded and queue were still long until the late evening. So we used single rider to avoid longer waiting time for our 2nd round of ride. My sons loved there so much. Not that big we could look around within a day, which is good thing for us. For attractions, Transformer 4D, mummy, shrek 4D were great. Strongly recommend Water world show- they are perform twice a day at 1:30pm and 4:30pm. Human, cylon, and the water ride in Jurassic park were good for me but seems some people dislike these ones due to the height or getting wet. The Water ride is definitely wet. Youd better preparing raincoat seriously. treasure hunter, troll show, puss in boots were just okay for us. There was lots of photo spot and characters so check the time first. Dragon and kungfu panda is at 7:30pm. For lunch, we had hotdog in jurassic park.

3128,4,user_3112,"I see some people complaining about the rides so here's my two cents: Download the app and show up before 11. First thing in the morning: start with Human, there should be almost no wait time. Right after that, you should get on the Mummy, there would be maybe 20 min wait time if you show up before 11:30. Then move to the far side further rides such as the Jurassic Park River or Shrek 4D. Meanwhile, definitely spend time on some small rides in that corner. Around 2, people will start heading for lunch, which means that Cyclone and Transformers will have like 10min wait time. After lunch, move to the front section, those rides are generally the emptier ones. Later at like 4:50, people will start lining up for Waterworld which means you can do any ride pretty much without waiting. Everyone gets into the Waterworld theater without issues and you don't have to spend 20 min waiting in line. People usually don't wanna sit in the splash zone, which means you can get good seats even if u show up late. Towards the end of the day, I'd do Canope flyer and Puss in Boots because you get views of the whole island and Singapore. We managed to do everything and it was a time we'll spent.

3138,4,user_3122,"Spending 6 hours at Universal Studios in Singapore was an interesting experience. If you purchase the Express Pass for over 7 million VND, you wont need to wait in lines everywhere. However, if you opt for regular tickets, be prepared to queue for each ride, which can take anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes, sometimes even with 100 people ahead of you! The term rides here doesnt necessarily mean actual games; it often refers to attractions where you sit and enjoy the experience. Universal Studios offers various themed areas, including NYC, Transformers, Ancient Egypt, Jurassic Park, and Far Far Away (soon to have a Minion land). However, there arent too many games. If you visit, prioritize the Jurassic Park ride (remember to bring a raincoat from homeit costs 10,000 VNDbecause the 6 SGD per person fee here will leave you as wet as a soaked mouse! ). Next, try the Transformer ride (it felt so real that it made my heart skip a beat). Theres also an impressive show that recreates an action scene from JAWS, directed by Steven Spielberg. Its fantastic, although experiencing 2-3 scenes instead of just 1 would be even more satisfying! For younger visitors, the other attractions are more relaxed.

3211,2,user_3195,"Among all Universal Studios this one is by far the smallest, with it's rides being very short as well. Usually you'll wait in line for 30 to 45 minutes only to ride for 30 seconds (Jurassic Park etc., 75 seconds at Treasure Hunters) Food is expensive and we had the worst, tasteless and most expensive hotdog in our lives (S19, there's only one Hot Dog counter). Corndog was delicious on the other hand (S7). I advise against drinking Coca-Cola from tap counters - only bottled. If you're adrenaline junkie you'll only fancy 2 rides - Cylon and Mummy. The rest of the rides are very easy going and slow. Battlestar Galactica rides: Cylon is way more intense ride than Human. Lockers for putting away your stuff are free for limited amount of time (anywhere from 45 - 120 minutes, depending on the waiting lines), after that it's payable (mostly S8 for additional hour, or maximum S20 in total). The lockers in Jurassic Park are payable, but you can keep your belongings with you (next to ""Jungle Rapids""). Dry Zone is payable S5 for 3 minutes. We arrived at 10am, just when they opened. I recommend you do the same and go straight to the Land Far Far Away or Jurassic Park. Most people start at the beginning, so the first rides (Transformers) immediately get packed whilst farther away rides are stills empty. It gets packed between 11.30am and 3pm. After 3pm there's hardly any line longer than 20 minutes. Also, their line-time counting is horrible - we'd seen ""waiting time 40 minutes"", decided to give it a try and still attend the ride, and it would be completely empty - we got the first-row ride, that's how empty. For example, our favourite, Cylon, was consistently 45 minutes waiting time prior 3pm, but after 3pm we ran around 5 times, because waiting was maximum of 5 minutes.

From heart-pounding rides to delightful food options, USS truly knows how to deliver a memorable day. Here are some highlights: 1. Roller Coaster Cylon: This ride is an absolute must-try! Its the most thrilling roller coaster Ive ever been on. The twists, turns, and sheer speed will leave you breathless and wanting more. A definite highlight of the park! 2. Transformers 3D Ride: Prepare to be blown away! This ride is more than just a simulatorits an immersive experience. Wearing 3D glasses, youre thrust into the world of Transformers as your ride car moves and reacts to the action. It genuinely feels like youre part of the movie. Hands down, the best ride Ive ever been on! 3. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure: If you love water rides, this is for you! Get ready to be soaked as you navigate through thrilling rapids. Pro tip: bring a poncho and an extra T-shirt and socks, because you will get wet. Its an absolute blast! 4. Halal Food Options: For my fellow Muslim visitors, you can enjoy delicious halal fried chicken at Goldilocks. Its not just convenient but also incredibly tasty! 5. Exceptional Staff: A massive shoutout to Hanafi and Boon from the USS team. Their friendliness and impeccable customer service made our visit even more enjoyable. Special thanks to Hanafi for going above and beyond by iron steaming my new KungFu Panda T-shirt. You guys are amazing! While my day at USS was fantastic, there are a few areas where the park could elevate the experience even further. Some rides and attractions could use a bit of upgrading and touch-ups to maintain their top-notch quality. Additionally, the Naruto Gallery currently showcasing at USS has a lot of untapped potential. Right now, it mostly features posters and background stories of beloved characters like Naruto, Sasuke, Jiraiya, and Orochimaru. Given the massive fanbase for Naruto both inside and outside of Singapore, introducing more interactive and engaging elements could make this gallery a major attraction.

3328,5,user_3311,"Universal Studios Singapore is a thrill-seeker's dream come true! I spent an adrenaline-packed day exploring the theme park, and it was an absolute blast. The roller coaster rides were the highlight of my day - the Battlestar Galactica and Revenge of the Mummy rides had me screaming with excitement! The immersive experiences, sharp turns, and steep drops made for an unforgettable adventure. But it wasn't all about the rides - the WaterWorld show was a spectacular display of stunts, pyrotechnics, and action-packed fun. I was on the edge of my seat as the performers pulled off daring feats and explosive stunts. After all that excitement, I needed some retail therapy, and the Transformer shop delivered! I geeked out over the impressive collection of Autobot and Decepticon merchandise, and scored some awesome souvenirs to take home. The park's theming, attention to detail, and friendly staff all added to the magic of the day. Whether you're a fan of movies, TV shows, or just plain old-fashioned fun, Universal Studios Singapore has something for everyone. Highly recommend to buy express ride tickets.

3386,5,user_3369,"As a visitor to Universal Studios Singapore, I was blown away by the sheer excitement and variety of attractions. The inner child was just bursting to try out each and every attraction. But sadly, I could not because of the long queues and some breakdowns. Thus, I would recommend a little strategizing before you reach there though. Understand that the theme park is divided into 3 segments: The rides, the shows and the meet-and-greets. Depending on your priorities, choose the attractions. To help you out with the schedules and wait times, download the app and keep checking it for real time updates. I personally loved the Sci-Fi City, and Ancient Egypt Adventures. Transformers: The Ride, The Revenge of the Mummy coaster and the Battlestar Galactica coasters were the highlights and also the ones with the longest wait times. I would suggest to get here early or take the express pass. If you have kids with you, they will enjoy the Accelerator ride, Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase and Enchanted Airways. The Lights, Camera, Action! show and Shrek 4-D Adventure was a magical experience, while WaterWorld wowed with all the stunts. Meeting Shrek, Donkey, and the Minions made my day! Keep an eye on the schedule for the character interactions. I was livid with myself for missing out on Naruto: The Gallery Experience which I hear is a treat for anime fans. Do check it out if you plan better than me. Regarding the passes, I did not take the express pass as it was too costly, and I believe if you plan better, you can cover most attractions if not all with better planning. Also, I believe go to the park to enjoy and not to cover all the attractions. Soak in all the pleasures the park has to offer and let your inner child free. And don't forget to take loads of photos throughout the park and Overall, Universal Studios Singapore is a must-visit.

Also, the AC system is not available that much when you wait to enter at most of the attractions. Overall, it is really crowded so they get much money and they can invest in better AC system.

There were at least 3 attractions unavailable due to renovations etc. In addition, you would have had to pay 100 SPD per person for the ExpressLine, which is an absolute disgrace. As a family of three, we also paid another 121SPD entry fee for the aquarium and for the photo that you were allowed to take at the entrance (free), you would of course have paid 65SPD at the end of the tour, packaged as a souvenir. The aquarium was ok, I've seen bigger ones. The jellyfish were the most impressive thing for me. We would also have liked to visit Delphine Island, but we would have had to pay the entrance fee there too. All in all, in my opinion it wasn't worth the price we paid. I am very disappointed.

The rides were fantastic, with my favorites being the Transformers ride, Battlestar Galactica, and The Mummy. These rides were thrilling and well worth the visit. However, I encountered a significant issue with the line management. There were often no staff present to guide the lines or monitor the crowd, which led to many people cutting in line. A specific group (and race) was particularly disrespectful, blatantly cutting lines and even applauding themselves for doing so. They were in large groups, which made the situation even more frustrating and disrupted the overall experience. Additionally, in such a closed environment, the lack of proper ventilation became quite apparent, making it uncomfortable with the poor smell lingering around. Sadly, the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure was closed during my visit, which was disappointing as I was looking forward to it. Despite these issues, I would still recommend visiting Universal Studios Singapore. The rides and attractions are top-notch, but I would advise against going on weekends to avoid the large crowds.

3605,1,user_3587,"We went there and bought the general admission ticket for 8085 per person. Then, when we went inside, it was overcrowded. When we went for a ride, it was a 100-minute waityes, over 1 hour just for 1 ride out of 16 attractions. So, to overcome this, the park offers you an express ticket for 100 per person. The ticket counter will sell you a ticket, but most of the attractions are not suitable for kids under 122 cm. So it was a waste of money for us. Altogether, we spent 600 plus 100 for the cable car. By spending 100 on express tickets you will feel like VIP (Very Important Person) as normal crowd is waiting for hours an hours while you can come in and out very quickly. I should have left my feeling at home in Australia that everyone is equal as the park doesn't treat you like that. My question is when they can accommodate large express ticket crowd why not others or make 1 price ticket and only let limited crowd in and out like in Night Safari where you have to pre book. Or else increase the staff or attractions facility. Surely if the business is making money then investing in impoverment won't be a issue. It lacks simple management solutions even though it Universal Studios. The park is overcrowded with Indians tourist mainly. Please mind I am an Indian Australian too. Not against any race, but the park staff was not able to control the crowd. My family and I were pushed 3-4 times while waiting for the attractions. I was elbowed twice. My wife and kid was pushed back by a man so he could break the queue and come to the front of the queue. Also, by the way, most of the time, no one was following the queue. The park will keep selling tickets to make more money; it's like quantity but not quality. I would not recommend it to families with young children or infants and toddlers as it's a waste of time and money.

3722,5,user_3703,"If you are visiting singapore, this is a must place to visit. Similar to Disney world. Thrilled rides and lot of adventure exists. We Adults & Kids definetly love this, sometimes we think, we need to go the ride again & again. Best attractions which we shouldn't miss is Roller coster, Jurassic park rapid adventure, Canopy flyer, Avengers, Transformers, Revenge of Mummy etc., My badluck during visit is Revenge of Mummy is closed for maintenance. Every attractions is excellent. Better to start early in the day, make sure that we reach there by 9:30 am. Better to take MRT & bus to reach here. If we want to avoid waiting in queue, need to buy VIP pass, which costs more. For many attractions, the photography / video is not allowed. For some rides like jurassic park rapid adventure, bags are not allowed to take as there are high chances of getting wet. Few of them carry / purchase the rain covers to protect them from water. People who come early, first visit the attractions like Transformers, Avengers, Mummy etc., so there will be huge queue in front. If we want to avoid queue, better to come from last, so that we can avoid queues. Visit these attactions post the lunch, so that it will be empty. Food: - Food is costly here, we can carry some snacks / food to save money. Photo package: - People try to come and ask you to take photo package with unlimited photograph. If we take the package, sometimes the server will not work and finally we will end up of getting multiple tags. Consolidating photos from multiple tags will be tedious. Meet & Greet We can meet lot of characters like minions and few others and take photos. There are people who help to take photos with this characters using our phone. They take lot of photos too, so no worries. Though the ticket is costly, but it is worth to spend to enjoy.

Afterwards i went to Battlestar Galactica. i was already waiting my turn at the gate but everyone was suddenly asked to return to the queue. As all of us were waiting, there wasnt any information or explanation given. We waited for a good 10-15 mins before an announcement was made that there were technical difficulties and the rides are delayed. Waited for 10 mins and no updates were given how long. Slowly everyone started leaving. A man asked the staff what is happening and the staff only said we have technical difficulties and unfortunately we dont exactly know what is causing it. You can stay but we dont know how long it will take or you can leave. I waited for about 15 mins and they still said they did not know what the issue was. There wont be much they would do for service recovery either. So i feel like the early entry ticket was wasted or useless as i didnt get to ride at all afterwards. The ride was only working about 30 mins after i left which is about the same time that more crowds were forming. When i wanted to ride, the wait time was more than 2 hours. Not only did i not get to ride it, when i waited for the transformer photo taking, it also delayed for 10-15 mins. Now i understand as it might be difficult to wear the costume but it was kinda frustrating as the queue was under the hot sun. We were not allowed to wait under the shelter either as it is considered to be entering the staffs zone. USS used to be fun and enjoyable, now just seems to be full of delays and issues without any service recovery.

3848,1,user_3828,"We were really looking forward to visiting USS and unfortunately it was hugely disappointing and we ended up leaving early. Feels like weve wasted a precious day from our trip to Singapore on being hot tired sweaty frustrated and hugely out of pocket. Even though we went early and on a Monday there were such long lines, far longer than the stated time, the ride operators were so slow at each round of the ride they fill it up with like 70% of the people with fast track tickets so felt really unfair. The fast track ticket was nearly as expensive as the main ticket and you have to buy it at the same time as the main ticket. We had a one year old baby and it was very frustrating to just have to carry him in a 40 minute plus queue, we ended up leaving most queues. Even the free shows, you have to get to them in advance otherwise you just miss them and have to wait another two hours for the next show. The meet and greet was so boring, unlike other theme parks where you can interact with the characters, here they just stand behind a rope and people queue up in the heat to take a quick photo and leave. The food again was also majorly disappointing, the cheapest thing you could get was water for 4 and soda for 5 everything else is double restaurant price too and not many great options, mainly just junk food and only 3 are halal. On a positive note the decor in the park was really nice but unfortunately just nothing interactive that you can enjoy without having to queue up for. At the very least they should make all queuing areas air conditioned and properly shaded, not just some far away fans and plastic canopy. There arent even benches to just sit outside to have a rest people just sit in the pavement or have to sit in a restaurant and pay for food. Just overall really not worth the price, came home so deflated unfortunately and wanting a refund as we did not enjoy it.

The park is divided into several themed zones, each with its own attractions, shows, and dining options inspired by popular movies and TV shows. One of the standout features of USS is its attention to detail in recreating iconic scenes and environments from beloved films. Whether its the magical world of Harry Potter in the Far Far Away zone or the thrilling rides based on blockbuster movies like Transformers and Jurassic Park, theres something for everyone to enjoy. The live shows and performances, such as the WaterWorld stunt show and the Sesame Street character parade, add to the parks lively atmosphere and entertainment value. While USS offers a world-class entertainment experience, some visitors may find that the park can get crowded, especially during peak seasons, which may result in longer wait times for popular rides and attractions. Additionally, ticket prices and costs for food and merchandise inside the park can add up quickly, making it a relatively expensive outing.

It takes about 20 minutes (good savings, get to sit and watch the view on the side of the road). Park at the Casino, walk straight, turn left and go up the escalator to the USS. Price comparison card from Klook Trip and Agoda Klook had a 10% discount so I got it for 1,980 baht, for the child it was 1,480 baht, bought it close to the day of the trip. Check the waiting time for the ride in the Universal SG app. The waiting time is not long, so don't buy Express. There are very few people inside, so you can play Transformer without having to wait in long queues. Then go to Jurassic Ride inside first, there are few people as well. Bags must be deposited in a locker for 4. Bring a raincoat. In conclusion, I didn't wear it and it didn't get as wet as I thought. (But other people were very wet) Played a lot of things. There were hardly any queues. Walking was comfortable. The weather was very hot. Download the app and look at meet&greet times. It helps a lot. Come take photos with the mascots and meet a lot of dinosaurs. Which rides stop being renovated when the park opens? Download the app to check in advance. Last time I played Mummy and almost fainted.

3982,5,user_3962,"Once in a lifetime experience, a must go destination if you are in Singapore. On weekends/public holiday there are too many people and big-big queues for any ride so my recommendation is going for express ticket else you wouldn't be able to have all the rides or see all the shows in 1 day. If you have normal ticket then it can take even 1 hour to be in queue and just cover 1 ride like transformer. Few rides might have shorter queue but again 30 min is minimum you have to wait for any ride. All the rides are worth going for and will provide you different experience. We could cover 3 rides and 2-3 shows overall in whole day and express ticket could have helped in covering all the rides. Though many rides are for adventurous people as they are either roller coaster or some other high speed rides and not everyone would love to do them so in that case normal tickets will be good enough. Transformer ride is a must go ride and will provide you a thrilling experience, it is a 3D ride and a unique experience, worth waiting for 1 hour in the queue for it. Stunt show was good and should be covered. Jurassic ride (Rapids Adventure I guess) is good but then at the end your clothes get wet so better to carry an additional pair or use rain coats (which is provided, might be at additional cost though).

Bring tumbler or water bottle as you can refill it at almost all restrooms area where there's drinking water machine. Food is slightly more expensive, given it's tourist spot, but quality is there. Fair. Download apps, check the special showtime and plan your tour so that you can catch the best show. Bring light raincoat if you want to play water games and avoid purchase expensive raincoat on the spot. Staffs most of them are friendly and helpful. Just remember to smile and ask them nicely.

4028,5,user_4008,"Ill be the first to admit that Im a huge theme park fan, so when planning to visit Singapore, Universal Studios was an absolute must visit. The theme park is on Sentosa Island, which is about 30 minutes from Marina Bay, and is very easy to get to. I was using a GoCity Singapore pass to get entry, so you simply redeem the pass on the GoCity website and you get a ticket emailed directly to you - you simply then proceed to the turnstiles with no wait. The park itself felt both familiar and different which I loved. You knew you were in a Universal park as it had lots of flagship rides, restaurants and attractions, but there were also lots of unique additions that you wouldnt find anywhere else too. We started our day on the parks 2 biggest roller coasters - Battlestar Galactica: HUMAN vs CYLON. HUMAN is the side where you sit down and it doesnt loop, whilst CYLON is a suspended roller coaster with 3 loops. Both were surprisingly thrilling and fun, and were a real highlight of our visit. Some of the parks other fantastic attractions include the jawsome Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, which was an absolute soaker of a river rapids, Revenge of the Mummy, a thrilling launched roller coaster with some epic theming, and the incredible Transformers: The Ride, a thrilling 3:D dark ride. Theres loads for all the family to do at the park, my particular highlights were the hilarious Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chace, which was a rather bonkers ride and the land of Far Far Away was brilliant. Im not the biggest Shrek fan but still found the whole area very amusing. Theyre also getting ready to open a Minions Land which will add even more. We also caught Waterworld, their amazing stunt show, which always impresses me even though Ive seen it in Universal Hollywood - its not to be missed. We went mid-week out of school holidays and it was still busy, but did quieten down for the last 2 hours. The queues for the biggest rides more than halved in the last hour. We did buy Express Passes which we did online in advance, and I found them very reasonably priced for the amount of queues we skipped. We spent from around 10am until 5pm at the park, and covered most things multiple times with our Express Pass. I throughly enjoyed my day at Universal Studios Singapore, its a great theme park with lots to do, some great entertainment and a really vibrant atmosphere.

There are a total of 24 attractions, of which 18 are original or specially adapted for the park. The park consists of seven themed zones which surround a lagoon.

The crowds are lesser on these days, the chances of shorter queues for the rides are definitely higher. 1-Day Admission Ticket (Super Peak): S 92.00. [ADD-ON] Express Pass - Single Pass: S 87.50. The wait times are around 90 minutes and the park is open for about 7-8 hours. They sells one-day pass tickets and express tickets. A regular ticket would cost you 76 when you buy on the day itself. However, it is highly recommended that you book your tickets online, mainly because it's cheaper and you won't have to queue! Generally, most visitors spend a full day at the park, which can range from 8 to 12 hours. However, if you want to experience everything the park has to offer or plan to visit during peak season, you may want to consider allocating two days for your visit.

There was no checking of our bags. ENVIRONMENT: The roads are spacious and full of greenery. The shops and rides look new and clean, and the decor is adorable. Most rides have canopies/coverage with plentiful fans when lining up. RIDES: One land was closed for renovation when I went, so there were 12 rides and 8 shows in the park. My personal favourites are: - Mummy Ride: A roller coaster with a great balance between storyline, atmosphere and simply a good rollercoaster. - Shrek 4D Adventure: A 4D movie whose storyline happens after the SHREK 1 movie. The aircon and chairs are very comfortable and great for relaxing after walking around in the heat. - MELS: A 3-person performance of the greatest pop hits in history. A small scale show on the streets but very fun and energetic. FOOD: There are 8 restaurants and some food carts scattered around the park. Most sell fast food, noodles and some local dishes. Snacks and drinks cost around 8-10 SDG, AND dishes cost around 15-20 SDG. MY OPINION: A fun park with great theming. Its kept clean and safe, and I especially appreciate the enthusiastic attitudes of the staff working there. However, it is a relatively small park (we went on 90% of the rides in one day on a Friday).

Making our way to the park was really easy, thanks to the convenient Sentosa Express.

We booked the Fast Pass Tickets, which helped us maximize our time by skipping queues so we could enjoy most of the attractions throughout the day. Of all the attractions, The Battlestar Galactica: CYLON is our favorite, an adrenaline-pumping roller coaster that transported us to another dimension with its speed and thrills. The park's size proved to be both good and bad at the same time.

Transformers was brilliant! Loved shrek 4d too. I was in awe when I saw the water on the other side in Lights, cinema and action ! It felt surreal ! There was a performance by group of artists in a theatre with the most lively and bright decor I have ever been to ! A great message delivered through the show! We covered treasure hunt for the sake of it ! Nothing much there but still good to tick it off.

4383,4,user_4360,"Universal Singapore is a smaller version of Universal Orlando. Tickets are cheaper than Orlando's, which is justified by the smaller number of attractions. I found the park more geared toward children, but adults can also have fun. The outdoor areas are a very interesting experience and reflect the country's history well. When I was there in February 2024, there was a construction site for a new attraction. I faced a few lines, and in one of them there was a technical stoppage with no forecast for the ride to return. I found this frustrating, because they were encouraging people to give up. I was at the front, and if I gave up, I would have to wait in line when the rides started working again. The right thing to do would be to clear the line and close the ride. The best thing to do is to download the Universal app, where you can favorite the rides you want to go on, and in the app you can track the queue time. The problem is that you can't follow the route in sequence, and you go back and forth to places when the queue is shorter. The best time to avoid waiting in line is at the end of the day. Then the queues are much shorter. Just pay attention to the shows, which have limited times. As for food, there are some options that aren't so cheap, but I didn't think they were exorbitantly priced. I went there and came back using a ride-hailing app to save time, but on the way back the drivers don't accept rides, and it's more expensive than the outward journey. The island and the area near the park are also very beautiful attractions. If you have time on your trip and are traveling with young people and children, it's a good experience.

4451,2,user_4428,"As someone who has visited many theme parks around the world and most of the Universal sites worldwide Universal Singapore operates like no other theme park and not in a good way. The biggest issue here is how the rides operate with regards to lockers. In order to ride some of the rides they do not allow you to have anything in your pockets at all. This is very different to every other theme park I've been to where they understandably don't allow bags or backpacks so you have to use the lockers but items in your pockets are allowed everywhere else but here. The first problem is they do not make this clear when you are queuing so when you get to the front of the queue and are scanned by a metal detector wand it detects your phone / wallet etc. and you are told by the miserable staff member that you need to put this in a locker despite having already queued and dropped your bag off at the locker before joining the ride queue. They do allow you to return to the front of the queue but this could be avoided by having someone inform the visitors while they queue. So once you have placed everything you carry into a locker you then queue for the ride. Sounds ok, right? Wrong. The lockers are only free for a set amount of time (45 mins) which if you are a theme park regular you will know is nowhere near enough time to queue for a ride so you then get charged a rate of 2 for every 10 mins past the free 45 mins. A complete scam. For context Universal Florida give you a few hours free. If you aren't already annoyed at your experience so far once you get off the ride to collect you items you then discover that you do not have your bank cards to pay for the locker as they are locked away so you now have to find an employee who can unlock your items for you and then you have to pay them in cash which not everyone will have so you then need to go find some cash. It's infuriating and such a colossal waste of valuable time in the park. After 1 ride I'm so angry at the entire situation and genuinely don't want to be there anymore. Ride staff are miserable and extremely unhelpful throughout the day. For contrast the staff in the retail stores are very friendly and helpful. Maybe this is better training, maybe it's working environment (air con) staff in restaurants were a mixed bag. Some were friendly, some were just rude. Food in the park was actually pretty good and unlike other theme parks wasn't ridiculously expensive. We bought tickets that included a Chinese New Year promo meal which meant each area of the park offered a different option for this so it's worth shopping around to find the best looking meal. We opted for duck wraps from the Shrek themed area and they were very large and delicious. Had we known portion size we would have used one voucher here and bought something else from another area. Not all the food was good though. In Mel's Diner from back to the future I ordered a sundae that was a half filled cup of semi melted ice cream and not the swirled ice cream with strawberry sauce as pictured (see pics). When we complained about this to staff in both English and Chinese (my wife is Malaysian Chinese) they just laughed and walked away. Wait times for rides were posted incorrectly. E.g. 15 mins for The Mummy when we queued for over an hour. Other issues encountered include Staff allowing groups of tourists to join the single rider queues when it was very clear they were all together and just attempting to queue jump, 3D glasses for transformers ran out so had to wait for staff to replace. no one stopping use of phones, queue management was awful. Filling up rows 1 person at a time instead of 4. The park is very small compared to other theme parks so there is no excuse for the multitude of errors we saw when visiting. In fact this should be the best operated Universal Location due to the size but it's by far the worst we've been to. Would I return here? Absolutely not.

During the last few hours of the day the rides free up and there's no waiting time at all for almost all rides, with or without the priority pass. There are around 15 rides, not all suitable for all ages: for 1-2 year olds only 1-2 rides are ok, for kids under 120cm about 4-5 rides are unavailable (main 2 rollercoasters, the mummy ride which can get scary, and some others... But there's a kid friendly rollercoaster too with unexpectedly high speed) Most of the rides are unique, each one with a different objective: some are speed coasters, others ride and show, 4D events, water splash, discovery, etc) There are also a lot of meet & greet events throughout the day, where you can take photos with various characters (transformers, egyptian characters, cartoons characters, etc)",2/18/24,Weekday,No wait,high_tolerance,31.68,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.1531,0.0050000000000000044,0.5,0.9388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9388,1,0,0,0,1.0,2,3,3,0.39375,0.95,1.0,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.07817010833652925,0.083,0.5,0.0,0.0

4490,3,user_4467,"Hello to every who's gonna read my review. i will share a very brief details on my experience i had during the public holiday. Of course compare to where I came from, the rides at USS were exceptional, amazing and wonderful. I especially love the ride ""Revenge of Mummy"" and the huge rollercoaster ""Battlestar Galactica: Human"". It was extremely enjoyable that my siblings and I could not stop moving trying to queue up on our next rides. Something to be aware of: 1. For muslims, the food outlets inside the theme park mostly consist with the selling of beers and non-halal food/drinks but there's one halal stall at the Far Far Away Land area called the ""Goldilocks (something)"" so.. for foreigners, you might as well have breakfast at home and bring some snacks along with you. 2. Be aware that the queue is a no joke thing, it can be extremely long especially ""Revenge of Mummy"", ""Battlestar Galactica: Cylon"", ""Puss In Boots' Giant Journey"" and all of the Jurrasic Park rides. To be frank, the queue might take up to 1-2 hours especially during peak time 11-2pm. So it's a matter of you willing to wait or not. 3. Be aware of people (especially foreigners who's Indians). Sadly, from my experience, they tried to cheat on us and cut our queue to access the ride faster and be ahead of us Not only that, they pushed one of my family members during the queue multiple times to the point we have to speak up. Totally not a pleasant experience. 4. You can access the link of USS by scanning the bar code posted right before going into USS as this will provide you with a map of the theme park, the rides available on that day and its estimated waiting time. 5. Lastly, my other main reason as to why I had to rate USS 3-4/5 was because of some rude behaviours of the workers. Yes it's understandable that you have been working a whole day taking care of the rides under the hot sun and dealing with customers/visitors but that does not justify the rudeness and incompetency that you had show towards these people who not only bought tickets to have a good time playing rides in the theme park but also are the ones who enabled you to have the paycheck you're receiving. For the Sesame Street Ride lady waiting in front of the door, I am here to write to you on how rude you were and that your statement, tone and how you shouted at customers are totally NOT professional and a disgusting behaviour. If you cannot cope with working there to the point you had to push and shout at customers just because the rides were closed then you should have just resign. In other words lady in blue shirt with glasses working at Sesame Street ride at 7.55pm on 10th February 2024, you could have provide us visitors with better approach instead of what you've done, not only that it had also caused us to have a tainted image of this ""good and friendly neighbourhood of Singapore"", it had also stained our excitement by the end of the day at USS. Suggestions: 1. Better maintanence on the rides as by the end of the day some rides closed down due to maintanence and it take quite long compared to during lunch time (about 5mins). 2. More Halal food stalls for the muslim, easy access to Prayer rooms and please clean the toilet, it's quite stinky, dirty and the rubbish was too full that it falls out to the floor. 3. Improvements of customer service (eg. don't be rude and be friendly) 4. To reduce waiting time, every available seats per ride should be completely filled.

I had to wait for almost an hour for the rides I could ride, but the weather helped and it was cloudy most of the time, so I made it through. If the sun was hot, it would have been difficult to endure. Although the overall scale is smaller than Universal Studios Japan, the rides were much more fun and scary than those in Japan. Personally, I think Japan competes with screens that feature flashy characters and rides that aren't scary. In Singapore, the fear was much greater as I didn't know what would come out of the darkness. I finally got a seat after waiting for the restaurant. It was next to the waffle shop past Jurassic Park, and the chicken was bigger than the original one, so I couldn't eat it all. The food was salty. They only gave me a cup because the drinks had unlimited refills. I wasn't able to see the water show because the timing wasn't right, but as I was passing by the entrance to the water show, I saw a show (?) where a baby dinosaur hatches from an egg, and it was quite realistic and fun. I couldn't ride much even after walking over 20,000 steps due to a failure in the game of wits, but next time I go, I'm going to try riding some equipment I haven't been able to ride.",2/16/24,Public holiday,No wait,high_tolerance,15.360000000000003,satisfied,time_tolerant,-0.6652,-0.055,0.25,0.2574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2574,0,0,1,0,1.0,1,3,4,0.2625,0.8,1.0,0,0.2691427382438618,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.03449107836094361,0.076,0.0,0.0,0.0

What we got was a total of hours of waiting in confusing rooms at the individual attractions and ultimately a cancellation on our part because we simply couldn't stand anymore. You're not a young 30-year-old who can stand the endless waiting and standing. At Transformers, at Battlestar Galaktika and in the Temple of the Mummy we queued for well over 3 hours and ultimately saw nothing!!! With such a hefty entrance fee, this was the most expensive wait and the biggest disappointment we have ever experienced. What I found particularly bad was that there was no indication of waiting times in the morning hours. Only when we left the studios in the afternoon, deeply disappointed and pissed off, did we see waiting times (45-80 minutes). I also have to mention that you can and probably should buy express entry (extra entry with shortened waiting times) for 100 SGD per person if you want to experience anything at all in this park and dont want to spend almost the entire time of your stay waiting.

4614,5,user_4590,"I will request whoever comes across my review. Please patiently go through it as it shall help you. If you are visiting this place , make sure you have an entire day only for Universal Studios, and you start very early. From wherever you are staying, you need a taxi/bus till the mount fabre cable ride, or you can go via cab/ mrt to the sentosa resort world station or via bus.. The cable ride costs 35 sgd per person, but other mentioned options are cheap. After you reach the first ticket counter to all the activities you shall realise there are a lot of options. Look at the photo with a list for reference. My suggestion is to not cut any tickets from there if you are visiting Universal as after reaching the universal, you have to stand in line to collect your tickets again. So better cut it after reaching the main gate. Also, it is highly recommended that you book it before, as online tickets are much cheaper, but at the gate, it is 88 sgd per person for the non vip line. To reach the main gate and counter of Universal studio, you take a train from imbaya Station. Now after getting your ticket you should enter the place without any food and water. You have to buy it from inside only after crossing the scanner. After that, as you go for a ride, expect to wait in queue for nothing less than 15 to up to 160 mins.

I would recommend everyone to get the tickets via their website as it offers 1 hour early access. The park offers a thrilling array of rides and attractions, creating a captivating atmosphere for visitors. However, my excitement took an unexpected turn when we got stuck on one of the rides (the Transformers). The staff kept us updated and we were given an express pass as compensation. This hiccup slightly dampened the experience, highlighting a need for better maintenance and operational efficiency. Another ride went again into maintenance after we reached the front of the queue after waiting half n hour, another disappointment (The chase of the mummy) On the culinary front, the variety of food options was commendable, but I couldn't ignore the steep prices. The expensive food choices were a drawback, making it less budget-friendly for visitors. It would be beneficial for the park management to reconsider pricing strategies to enhance the overall value for guests. Additionally, while most staff members were helpful, I encountered instances where a bit more politeness could have made a difference.

Go up the escalator, then you will meet the UNIVERSAL Globe Ball (everyone's favorite photo spot). Because we use a tour vendor, all USS ticket accommodation is facilitated, just check in at the gate. This is on a weekday, it's quite busy but comfortable enough for photos. The prices of food, snacks and other snacks here are quite expensive, in Singapore Dollars, prepare enough funds, master cards, QR payments, cash are also still accepted. There are lockers available to store luggage or other things if you want to enter the vehicle, provided that without any luggage, cellphones, coins, raincoats, shoe covers, even mountain shoes must be removed. If you don't want to queue, you can use an Express Card, there are several options for just 1 ride, or several rides but you can only play 1 time, or unlimited (the latter apparently can cost up to 200 Singapore Dollars). Don't forget for those who drink a lot, there are drinking water refill spots for tumblers or direct drinks. So all toilets, clean and comfortable. There are quite a lot of tables in the restaurant/cafe, there's still a chance of getting a table quickly, unless it's peak season, school holidays or something else. The price of food at the restaurant I went to was in the range of 20 - 40 Singapore Dollars, not including drinks. When I came in January, it rained all day starting at 1 pm, you had to prepare a rain coat, shoe cover and bag cover. It's comfortable going around the rides, and it turns out that what used to be a waiting list of 60-100 minutes in heavy rain conditions has become around 5 minutes!!! You should install the USS application in Playstore, so you can monitor updates on waiting times for each ride.

Securing the one-hour early entry ticket (9 AM) was a game-changer, allowing me to explore at least five attractions before the crowds descendeda practical and cost-effective choice compared to the pricier express ticket. While most of the rides boasted minimal wait times, a brief snarl at Battlestar Galactica added an unexpected twist. A croc slipper mishap caused a 30-minute delay, turning a 10-minute wait into 40 minutes. However, this hiccup aside, the majority of attractions featured wait times ranging from 5 to 40 minutes, depending on the time of day. The WaterWorld show, a captivating spectacle, became a highlight of the day with two performances, and catching the 1:30 PM show proved to be a rewarding choice. The Jurassic Park area offered a culinary respite, though prices were steepa common theme in amusement parks. Despite the cost, the food was delectable, living up to the ""amusement park pricing"" standard.

It was just the smallest fridge magnet. Not worth it. Included in the ticket was an hour early entry before the place opened at 10am. It was quite up until 11am then got busy. Wait time was around 5 to 30 mins. We had done all the rides with 2 to 3 hours including some shows.Place looks a little run down some rides and shops didnt open til after 10am so paying for an hour early entry wasnt worth the trouble. It was rainy and ponchos were S6 which I thought was expensive. Even though the tickets states strictly no outside food , I saw a lot of people eating food/drinks they had bought from home. And yes food is very expensive inside universal. There are some lockers which are free for 45 mins and then you get charged afterwards. These are located near the revenge of the mummy ride some staff were friendly but most were grumpy and not helpful. I mean it was good not great. Like I was done in 3 hours and then we just looked around. Live performances and photos with characters was good but if you want to buy a photo ,it ranged from S30 upwards. We bought our photo with a transformer, with a frame for S50 . We took the bus to Vivo city then monorail return ticket around S4 each to Sentosa island.

4896,3,user_4869,"We went for an impromptu visit to Universal Studios Singapore and had already expected a high crowd as it was a day before Christmas. The overall experience at Universal Studios Singapore was a mix of excitement and frustration. Despite the thrilling rides and attractions, - ticket prices were jaw-breaking expensive, costing almost 200 for 2 adults and 1 child - dining experience was hectic with long queues and limited seats especially over at Mel's Drive. This made it challenging for us to enjoy a relaxed meal with our kids. Restaurants could have offered food with various texture suitable for all ages (e.g. porridge) to enhance its family-friendly atmosphere. Food and drinks are also outrageously pricey (which is expected). - push carts could have offered a wider range of halal food options to accommodate a more diverse visitor base with various dietary preferences. - there were significant wait times for the rides/ shows. Additionally, lack of child-friendly activities, limiting options for families with younger children. - outcome of the photo-taking at ""Sci-Fi City"" with ""Optimus Prime"" was a disappointment as the image turned out to be dark. The low visibility at night hindered the clarity of the photo and this was captured using both our phone and even with their camera. - restrooms appeared to be inadequately maintained, with dirty toilet cubicles and lack of toilet paper. - drying pod can be too warm for tall people (could have indicate a sign outside to warn users of the heat they might expect upon use). Nonetheless, it was still a memorable experience for us as we did not hold any expectations on experiencing the rides and shows with the high crowd (which finally settled down late afternoon). We were impressed that: - there was a prayer space provided for Muslims, - almost every attraction has a water cooler, - the performances were energetic and lively, - there was good crowd control for character meet-and-greet. We hope this feedback can contribute to improvements in the overall experience at Universal Studios Singapore and we also hope to see a more variety of shows and activities suitable for various age groups.",1/7/24,Weekend,Up to 10 min,critical_tolerance,17.6,satisfied,time_tolerant,0.1891,0.007000000000000006,0.25,0.9514,0.0,0.0,-0.1665,-0.039999999999999994,0.0,-0.039999999999999994,0.0,0.9514,0,1,0,5,1.0,0,4,11,0.11999999999999998,0.8,0.6666666666666666,0,0.1569912609238452,1.0,1.0,0.014216104982321667,0.108,1.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333

They say they were sold out within 2 hours of opening. I think it's because it's the end-of-year season. There was also a VIP ticket that included an express and private guided tour, but it was about 400 per person, so I thought about it but decided against it. In the end, it was a good thing I didnt buy it! Because it was a rainy day, there were times when people flocked to certain attractions. If you download the Universal Map app (required) and watch the real-time waiting times (make sure to bookmark things to ride, see, and eat in advance), you will be able to enjoy the experience efficiently. Since a lot of children come here, if you get the timing right, you can ride without having to wait, and if you're not afraid of rain, you can ride even more comfortably haha. Attraction Recommendations & Recommendations - Siron is more fun than Human - I didn't like Shrek 4D... - Transformers 3D front row seat recommended - Highly recommend the Water World show! - Mummy Recommendation - Jurassic Park Rapids recommendation (everything is wet. Everything is wet.) - Spaghetti is completely for babies haha. Recommended if you like cute things. -The Indian restaurant was delicious. - Most souvenirs are available at the universal shop at the entrance, so there is no need to stop by each shop. Additionally, Sentosa Island has ziplines and luges, so it would be nice to spend a day enjoying them all. After getting wet and raining, it got cold as the sun went down, so I bought a Shrek blanket and covered myself with it. I think it would be a good idea to bring a raincoat, towel, and blanket if you can.

Immediately after the park opened, there were almost no people lining up for the attractions, so I was able to ride Jurassic Park twice in a row with zero waiting time. It was busiest around noon and the wait for the Transformers was about 2 hours. After 6pm, it became empty and the wait for the Transformer was about 40 minutes, and after 7pm, the wait was about 10 minutes, so I rode it twice in a row. For food, the Malaysian food court on the right after exiting the USS may be a little cheaper and better. There is also a manned counter on the right side as you enter, so you can pay with cash. Also, I was able to buy the tickets a little cheaper because I paid with a coupon or PayPal, which is recommended for advance purchase. PayPal payments can only be used in Japan, so if you have a fixed schedule, I think it's a good idea to buy in advance.",12/31/23,Weekday,No wait,high_tolerance,31.68,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.024,-0.010000000000000002,0.4444444444444444,0.6971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6971,1,0,0,0,1.0,2,1,4,0.2571428571428572,0.8,1.0,0,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.027417001611011512,0.05,0.5,0.0,0.0

Now, on to the critiques and advices. Of course, every place has its flaws and these reviews are here to help build it for the better First of all, the queues. The queues will take you 15-60 minutes for only about 5 minutes of entertainment. That's why I would HIGHLY recommend getting the express ticket. You could upgrade your regular ticket to an express in the ticket booth up front. It is pricy at first sight, but the amount of rides you could experience and the amount of time you save is worth it. But note that not all rides accept express in the way that you need to wait as of the others. I would recommend bringing a change of clothes as it would often get hot, you'd get wet while riding a ride. In my case, I forgot to bring an extra change, so I had to buy one _. Last but not least, bring your family, friends, wife or husband, relatives, and so on. They will make the trip even better. That is all.

5048,3,user_5019,"Universal Studios Sentosa, while smaller than its counterparts, offers a pleasant theme park experience. With fewer rides, lines were manageable even on a weekday, peaking at around 40 minutes and dwindling later in the afternoon. I highly recommend buying tickets online in advance, because it is slightly cheaper to do so and you can buy a combo ticket package with other nearby attractions. We didn't find a need to buy the Express pass to skip lines, but it may be very useful during the holiday season and weekends. Despite a brief interruption due to rain and lightning, the adjacent aquarium provided a convenient and enjoyable diversion. Food and drinks are on the pricier side, but stumbling upon an unadvertised happy hour for drinks was a pleasant surprise. The policy of free lockers for an hour, with reasonable charges afterward, adds a practical perk. The park's cleanliness and organized lines contribute to a positive overall atmosphere.

5050,5,user_5021,"Many people wonder if they can enjoy all the rides without an Express Pass, and the answer is yes. Ensure you visit on a weekday, like Thursday and be right on time before the opening time, and the trick is to avoid entering the rides near the entrance first. Start with those in the back or the ones with high demand, such as the Transformers ride. In the evening, the rides near the entrance are always empty, so that's the perfect time to go there. Use the Universal Studios app to check wait times and navigate accordingly, rather than following a set order. Mark down the meet and greet times and spots to arrive right on time. The roller coasters are worth it, and lockers are free for a duration of around 30-40 minutes. We checked roller coaster wait times, selected lockers, finished the ride, switched lockers, and went to the next ride, so we didn't pay for lockers at all. If you still lack time you can skip the enchanted airways and magic potion spin which looks less exciting after riding the main roller coaster rides. Yes, the food and drinks are expensive, but having a big breakfast outside and the motivation to try all the rides meant we barely felt hungry, so we didn't dine there at all. You can take water inside, so no need to buy their overpriced water and drinks. All the rides and shows were excellent, providing a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

I bought a fast track bracelet for my family for all the games and I was surprised that there are games that do not include fast track. In one of the games I asked an employee on the fast track because the track board was not clear, unfortunately. He put me in a queue where I sat for an hour, and it turned out that the employee had racial fanaticism and deliberately put me in the wrong lane and did not put me in the express entry lane. There is poor regulation of express entry, meaning that There is a card that you buy to enter some games, fast entry, and this is the reason for its crowding and the lack of clarity about those who have the fast entry bracelet from the card. There is chaos, some of them enter the fast lane without having a card or bracelet, and they enter the game without any supervision from the organizers. 2- I also bought an express entry card for offers, although it was previously part of the express entry bracelet, but they separated it. Unfortunately, its price was very expensive, and entry was poorly organized because they were sorting people outside, but inside the hall the situation was chaotic. You would find everyone sitting in the express entry area, so I absolutely do not recommend buying it. Come ten minutes before the show and after you enter because there are no organizers inside, sit in the front where those who have... Express entry cards. 3- Previously, the studio opened at 10 p.m. and closed at 7 p.m., meaning (9 hours) and at an acceptable price, but now it opens at 11 a.m. and closes at 6 p.m., meaning (7 hours), at a high price, and a third of the studios games are closed. 4- It was a very bad experience and I was disappointed in Universal Studio due to the chaos, the negligence of the organizers inside, the restoration work, and the high prices. I do not advise anyone to visit it due to the presence of restoration work, as well as the presence of restoration work on Sentosa Island, and many of the events that were free on the island have become expensive and have become Concern is money, not tourist entertainment.",12/2/23,Weekday,3060 min,tolerance_collapse,35.0,dissatisfied,time_sensitive,-0.2672,-0.015,0.26666666666666666,-0.9787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.068,0.0,-0.9787,1,0,0,45,1.0,0,1,3,0.025,0.1,0.6666666666666666,1,0.18388472742405326,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.01659266848816029,0.034,0.5,0.0,0.75

It's a relatively small place and if you are not someone who enjoys rides or shows, this would be a waste of time and money. The rollercoasters and rides we tried were good. We do recommend going for Transformers and Revenge of the Mummy. Please expect long wait times for most rides unless you have a express or unlimited pass, for which of course, you shell out more. The show at WaterWorld was the highlight of our trip to USS. Definitely one of the best, if not the only thing we felt was worth going for. The prices for food and drinks are simply exorbitant inside. So prepare accordingly. There are lockers conveniently provided outside every ride to keep your bags. We also recommend going on weekdays.

What was disappointing is the food - relatively expensive, poor choice, bad quality. Soft ice cream was crunchy because it's over frozen. Overall eating here felt like rip off. Another big issue (might be local specifics, since we met similar problem at the hotel) are visitors. Around 60% of them belong to specific group that probably got to the park on a donkey straight from their remote village. Meaning they do not understand personal space, queues and personal hygiene. I personally get annoyed being around such type of people, but might be my personal view.

I wouldn't mind coming back again for sure to see it continue to grow! A lot of entertainment and the park would lead you in a circle which will bring you back out. So do not worry about being a maze since it is very easy to navigate. Keep an eye out in many events and the time when it starts! You do not want to miss those! I highly recommend those!

A big chunk of the park is currently closed as they're converting the area to Minionland. My family loves the Minions and is really looking forward to seeing it when I opens. Most of the park is well maintained, but some of it looks a little run down....especially the Shrek area (Far Far Away). There are a few really good rides here. I especially like the Revenge of the Mummy and the Human/Cylon rollercoasters. You need to empty your pockets for those rides and there are nearby lockers that are free for 90 minutes. Overall, I like Universal Studios Singapore, but mostly go here because of a lack of options in the area. This park is nicer than Legoland Malaysia, but also quite a bit more expensive.

The themes and activities were very well planned, and as parents, my partner I were impressed with everything there was to see and do for us and our 3-year-old. However, the relentless humidity and heat made waiting in the long queues quite unpleasant. On a positive note, the staff were excellent and very helpful; we didn't encounter any unhelpful staff throughout the park. Our biggest disappointment came when we tried to grab some food. Unfortunately, all the food outlets had a technical issue and couldn't accept card payments. We didn't have any cash on hand, and without food, both our toddler and we couldn't fully enjoy all the rides and attractions. It's disheartening to know that a massive establishment like Universal Studios couldn't resolve a technical issue or organize an alternative for its visitors. At this point, I'm not sure if we'll be returning. It's frustrating that such an issue could significantly impact our experience.

Once during lunch and 2x again when it's about to close so there's no queue. Best ride ever! I will go back to USS just for this. * Waterworld stunt show - really amazing performance and stunts by the actors. It was 130pm * Human battlestar galactica - a compromise if your companion is scared of the Cylon one but I like the mummy more * Spaghetti space chase - gosh this is the cutest ride ever!

5575,5,user_5544,"Universal Studios Singapore, 29 September 2023 Hiii, this is my first time playing far away from Singapore exploring alone in someone else's country. Starting from the accommodation at 10.00 Dunloop Street, walk towards Little India to take the MRT to Vivo City. Arriving at Vivo City we go straight to the bus stop, there is a special stop for Sentosa - HarbourFront Stn, about 30 minutes with views of the city across the bridge until we arrive at USS yeaaaaaa.. Alone on the USS? yup, explore on your own, (noted: you have previously ordered USS tickets on OTA, guys) so when you arrive at USS, take a photo first in front of the Universal Studios Singapore icon. Erm, because I was alone, I was brave enough to ask another tourist to take a photo, hehehe... armed with it, Hi miss, can you help me to take a picture here? Luckily they want to, or sometimes take photos instead. Wait, if you go to USS, your provider doesn't have a signal, don't worry. Because at USS there is public wifi that can be used. It's a good idea if you go to USS to download the Universal SG app, why? because with this application you can know the location of rides and waiting times in line. Very useful for those of us who want to try all the rides. Because I'm alone, I can really queue at Single Rider, a queue that complements the regular queue where they usually want to ride at the same time as friends or family, honestly this saves a lot of time. Yes, although not all rides can do it. Every certain time there is a show like that, you can check the app for the schedule, so we can take photos with several icons, come here Minnion tunes, transformers etc. There are several rides where it's best not to bring luggage (for example hats, glasses, cellphones) you can store them in a locker first, it's free within a certain time limit. You can try all the rides, the most impressive one is of course the Sci-Fi City ride on the Human Battlestar Galatica, I wanted to try the Cylon one but the queue was 80 minutes at that time, it was really long, The second ride that is a must try is in Ancient Egypt, you have to enter through a long corridor with a very mummy atmosphere, you get a really scary feel, riding a train in the dark. At the end there will be a photo of us taken while riding the ride, you can also ask for a print, hello. The third ride is at Lost World, Canopy Flyer and again it is great for single riders.

This spine-tingling event features five haunted houses, each with its own unique theme. From the chilling ""Weekend"" with a clubbing vibe to the haunting ""All of Us Dead"" inspired by Netflix, and even a school-themed experience, there's something else for everyone to explore. In addition to the haunted houses, there are three scare zones that provide perfect opportunities for video capture. Explore the eerie Hindu and Chinese themes, and discover the mysterious XXX theme as shown in my video. For the regular admission (peak times), it's 89 dollar per person. But for an unforgettable experience, consider the Halloween Horror Night RIP Tour at 349 dollar per person. This VIP package includes fine dining, express access to all haunted houses and facilities, even the rollercoaster with unlimited rides! Moreover, you'll get the 6D photos printed during a private meet and greet with the selected ghosts, and a tour guide will accompany you for 3 hours, explaining all the chilling themes. With the RIP tour, you won't miss any haunted house, and you'll finish early, making it well worth it. I've already attended for 2 years!

I used it on a weekday in early October, and I was able to enjoy it enough even without the Express, probably because there were fewer people on the move early in the morning. If you want to enjoy it for a short time, we recommend purchasing it, but if you have 5 or 6 hours to enjoy it, you may not need to purchase it. Please note that outdoor attractions will be closed if it rains [Accessibility] This time I used Grab from near MBS. It takes less than an hour to get there by public transportation, so if you have a large group, it may be more cost-effective to take a taxi.

If you have an express pass, you can skip them, but be sure to buy the express pass in advance as at the park, they had run out of them by 12PM. Book online via apps like Klook and the admission ticket would be much cheaper. The longest lines are at the Canopy flyer, Jurassic world and Cyclops. So Id recommended to anyone to get done with these rides as early as possible in the day before the queues start to get lengthy. A hack that nobody seems to have mentioned is: on some rides, you have a single rider line which is about 70-80% shorter than the regular queue and about 50% shorter than even the express queue. If youre visiting solo, or if youre in a group that is willing to split up for the ride, use these lines. Itll save you time and money.

The fare on Kkdays is about NT2,000, and the express customs clearance is about NT2,000. The admission ticket and the express pass are purchased separately. The admission ticket also comes with an additional six yuan of Singapore dollars that can be used to purchase souvenirs or food and drinks in restaurants. It cannot be consumed at roadside stalls and specific areas. The Halloween event is from 7:30-00:30 in the evening, so you can arrive early to take photos. There was no queue for us to enter the park, we only had to queue to enter the facilities inside. In addition to five haunted houses, three horror experience areas, and two music performances at night, almost half of the amusement facilities are open for fun. The most exciting thing is the roller coaster. There are many kinds of roller coasters in the park with different ways to play. The difference between a haunted house and a horror experience area is the indoor haunted house and the outdoor haunted house. There are occasionally some staff dressed as ghosts or zombies on the roadside in the park, but they are very calm and will not chase them. The makeup is not particular, and they basically just wear masks and costumes. The style of haunted houses is much different from that of European and American haunted houses in the United States, Canada, etc. Maybe its because everyones physical and mental health needs to be taken into consideration?

You can immediately venture into the popular rides (e.g. Transformer ride, Mummy ride, Battlestar Galactica etc.) to avoid long waiting time later. Do note that the opening hours during the Halloween period is slightly earlier and it is opened from 1000H to 1700H instead of the usual 1100H to 1800H. In addition, try to avoid bringing too much stuffs as some of the rides do not allow any handcarries. You can either place your stuffs at the lockers provided (never used it before but it is quite expensive) or leave it with a non-rider. Lastly, I will recommend to have your meals outside of USS as there are cheaper options at RWS or near the USS entrance. You can request for re-entry as long as you hold on to your tickets.

Compared to the past where the left side of the park had Madagascar etc, now that entire part of the theme park is closed for development of Minion land. Easily 1/3 of the park closed up? And many shows were available like twice a day only and if u miss those timings then too bad for u. So end up u miss many shows and miss the 1/3 of the park, and I dont see the ticket prices being reduced by 1/3 the usual. Note last time Covid they closed the Shrek 4D show. Now its still closed. Used to go a restaurant just opposite Jurassic land. Food was quite good. I think discovery something. It was closed too! And as u walk everywhere in the theme park, many wagons/stalls were closed too. And sgp weather is scorching hot, every queue is minimally 30 min long on a Friday. PLEASE DONT WASTE MONEY BUYING ICE CREAM THERE. Within 5 seconds of buying your ice-cream, its already 1/4 melted and dripping down your hands. Within half min, I can say its a terribly messy sight and mood dampener. Buy ice cream if you want to spoil your day and stain your clothes. Walking around u can see frowns on everyones faces due to the heat and many staff wore frowns on their foreheads plus giving a rude and cold attitude. Oh please. How do u expect guests to enjoy if most of your staff look so grumpy.... I dont mean all staff though. Some were nice and friendly but really only a few in numbers. Overall, I wont go back unless there is 1/3 price reduction until the minion land opens and all the attractions/shows and stalls/restaurants open. Then I think its justifiable.

Very few people walk around this area in this time of day, as some are seen taking shelter in the doorways of a shop or a restaurant (blocking the ways). I suggest adding more chairs & umbrellas for them to take shelter in. - I noticed some parts were not finished yet, like the magnificent far far away castle was still covered in facade.

5745,5,user_5713,"Universal Studios is an amusement park. All the rides are enjoyable but if you have really young kids from age group of 6-10, then many rides are scary for them. The donkey and Shrek show and Trolls show is enjoyable for the above mentioned age group.

5747,3,user_5715,"We had the opportunity to visit this theme park during our vacation. A very nice surprise from an originality and decoration point of view. The decorations are magnificent and impressive, particularly the Egyptian part... The attractions offered are relatively calm except for the two flagship thrill attractions... which also see their queues very long... The attractions present are new, not seen in any case at DisneyLand Paris. 3 stars because despite this environment, there are many negative points. Firstly, the opening hours of the park, it only opens at 10 a.m. and closes very early (6 p.m.)... when you want to enjoy the two most popular attractions, you have to wait 1h30 on average... which means that there is little time left to explore the park when you spend 3 hours waiting for two attractions. As a result, this makes the cost of entry quite significant: 82 Singapore dollars for an adult... you have the option of taking a VIP PASS, allowing you not to have to queue for the attractions, price per person in addition to the ticket: 80 dollars... help!!! Finally, the last black point, the lockers. The attractions cannot be taken with your bags and personal belongings, mobile phones are also prohibited in the attractions and in queues, so very few souvenirs... Lockers are then positioned for each of the attractions for a maximum period of use and then paying for it... which means that it is almost impossible not to have to reach into your wallet if you want to do the main attractions.",10/3/23,Weekday,No wait,critical_tolerance,21.12,satisfied,time_tolerant,0.9879,0.20800000000000002,0.5,0.9956,0.0,0.0,0.91,0.225,0.0,0.225,0.0,0.9956,1,0,0,0,0.5,0,2,2,0.15,0.3,0.6666666666666666,0,0.2691427382438618,1.0,0.0,0.21907966812116045,0.23,0.5,0.0,0.0

After passing through the arcade, you will reach the attraction area. There aren't many, but I get the impression that there are a lot of screaming ones. When riding the Sekyou-kei, you must leave all your luggage in a locker. This will be strictly checked. From bags to sunglasses and smartphones. Lockers are located near the attraction and are free for 45 minutes. First, operate on the touch panel The locker number to be used will be displayed Put your luggage in Be careful with Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure. People coming down were soaking wet. Some people were drying their shoes in the sun, and there were hair dryers for people. There were also people in swimsuits. The attractions we rode on were Sesame Street's Spaghetti, Canopy Flyer, Revenge of the Mummy, and Puss in Boots. Each wait time was 20-30 minutes. We ate, went shopping, and had fun until about 5:30 pm. Very compact. There seem to be few visitors. And since there are many things that USJ doesn't have, I really enjoyed it. Due to the weather, it rained in the evening. Is it because it's almost rainy season? There is a tempting souvenir shop near the entrance. This place deals with all sorts of characters. There are some things you don't see in Japan, and it might be a good idea if you forget to buy them. Purchase tickets online in advance.

Transformers is an excellent motion ride that nearly everyone can enjoy. The Mummy Returns is phenomenal, so much so, that I rode it twice-mostly a themed dark roller coaster ride, I loved the suspense of not knowing exactly what was coming next. The intertwining ""Human"" and ""Cylon"" coasters are lackluster compared to nearly every US coaster I've ridden. Especially, please, do not wait more than 10 minutes for the ""Human"" side; even with my UE pass, I waited nearly 1 hour and for the incredibly short, non-inverting, non-helixed ride, it was far from worth it. Unfortunately, the only other rides operating during our visit were meant more for kids and not much to report on. Shrek 4D still ""under renovation"". A comedy hour was canceled due to technical difficulties. We grabbed a single order of onion rings (4 large rings and a sauce) and an iced tea to bide our time.

A few tips to all the people who are going there: 1. If you are going to play the Transformers Galactica roller coaster, go line up at once. I had to line up for 90 minutes even if I went there first. 2. Check if the rides require you to store your bag into the lockers. You have to requeue if you have to put your bags in the locker. 3. The queue for Revenge of the Mummy is very quick in later hours as there are multiple cars. 4. For all the lone wolves going to the USS alone, check if there's a single-rider line. As I went there alone, I saved a lot of time queuing. 5. Download the USS app. It is very helpful as it has a map and all the wait time. 6. Eating lunch in the Malaysian food court is quite cheap, so if you want to save money, consider going there.

6041,3,user_6004,"My recent visit to Universal Studios Singapore was a mix of excitement and nostalgia. While the park had its moments of fun, it left me with the impression of a slightly dated and smaller version of the Universal Studios I've experienced in other locations. We chose to visit on a Tuesday, hoping for a quieter day, but to our surprise, the park was sold out. Unfortunately, express passes were also sold out before the park even opened. Nevertheless, we developed a strategy to make the best of our day. Our plan was to start with the Battlestar Galactica Cylon Ride as soon as the park opened. This decision paid off, allowing us to avoid the initial crowds and kick off our day with a burst of excitement. We then explored the rides at the far end of the park, including the Jurassic Park ride. With the help of the park's mobile app, we managed to keep our wait times to around 30-60 minutes per ride. A noteworthy part of our visit was the Battlestar Galactica Human Ride. I closely monitored the queue times and, when they dropped to under an hour, we joined the line. This is where the absence of express passes became a significant drawback. The ride had only 16 seats, and the express line consistently monopolized the coaster. Non-express pass holders, like us, were left waiting for extended periods while watching the express queue zoom past. This experience was undoubtedly the low point of our day. As the day progressed, the crowds thinned, allowing us to enjoy the Cyborg ride once more. This time, we secured seats in the front cart, which provided an incredible view and an exhilarating experience. In summary, Universal Studios Singapore offers a mix of thrilling rides and nostalgic attractions. However, I must note that the park is showing signs of wear and age, and it's noticeably smaller compared to other Universal Studios locations. It may be considered a lesser cousin to its counterparts, especially the one in California.

We went to transformers, it was closed. We then lined up for the Mummy and had to wait 100 minutes to get our ride. The ride itself was nice and exhilarating. The lonnnnnggggg wait was not. Cyclon and human were open by the time we finished the mummy but the waiting time was 2 hours! Single riders was not entertained either. No way! We were able to get to a jurassic ride, lights show, and then water world. Obviously, we wanted to experience more but the queueing time is such a downer. Had lunch in between. The hot weather does not help with the mood. They used to have water sprays back then. On our way out, we saw Panda mascot needing to be washed.

It's ok to go 10am early to go to the Aquarium first and then go to Universal. - It's just a pity that USS opens late and closes early so there aren't many games to play. - You should buy tickets online in advance to get in faster. - Even though the queue is very long (about 1 hour), most people will queue inside with air conditioning and each place they pass is decorated beautifully so it doesn't get boring, the waiting time doesn't feel too long. Trust me )) - Playing from noon to evening, 5 games are called the most unique in USS, so it's worth a try. - Those who travel on their own can book on Klook because I find that buying a Klook pass package allows you to choose a combo of many locations and the price is cheaper than tickets to other places.

6344,3,user_6305,"Enter only if you have an express pass. It does not make any sense if you just get the admission ticket and wait in hourly queues. Ticket prices are premium so even if taken from any sites like Klook etc would not make any difference. For Indians, ticket prices from Klook, with admission express, will be around 9,500 per person which as per Singapore standards is reasonable. Plan to buy tickets in advance. The queues at the spot are very long. Arrive 20 minutes before the starting time and skip long entry queues by showing your express pass at the entry counter. Try to complete either Jurassic ride or Mummy returns first. There will be no queue when the park opens. Later even the express queues get long and would be at least 30 mins of waiting. There are a few rides like Treasure Hunt (Ancient Egypt) and Jurassic Canopy rides that don't have express entrance but are in demand. If you are with a kid, you may want to spend some time during peak afternoon time at Far Far Away land and see some of the shows. Remember to carry Umbrellas and Sunglasses. By 4 30 pm, the queues we saw were less in Express and hence could visit Transformers ride almost with no queue in express. Overall, an okay experience. Nothing great if you have visited the LA Universal Studio. SG Universal Studio is a smaller, compact entertainment park. We didn't see any angry crew. In fact, all the staff were very friendly and helped in answering queries on directions. Tips 1. Do not visit without the Express Pass 2. Carry Sunglasses, umbrellas 3. Jurassic ride you will get wet. 4. Canopy rides in Jurassic, Puss n Boots, enhancement airways can be a bit scary for kids , but is okay for adults. 5. Mummy returns is a must scary ride 6. All rides are about 1 min max 7. Lights Action Camera, New York ride, Shrek 4D are okay for small kids too. 8. Staff are friendly. Ps: photo shows the rush for Mummy returns in the express lane.

You have to dig out simple info like stroller rental from the long list of FAQ. And there are many outdated FAQ that they don't even have the manpower to delete them. Map is not available in printer friendly version and outdated. And there is no basic info like where toilets are. The restaurant is extremely slow. It was only 1/3 full when we ordered food (some burgers and drinks) and it took them 30min to prepare such fast food! Waterworld is usually named as the best show. I appreciated the stunt performers a lot, but that's it. The show has been the same for over 20 years, at other Universal Studios. It was fun 20 years back then, but are these effects still amazing now? The show was stopped in the middle due to a lightning. I support the stop as this is safety. But that's what you have to expect, the shows or rides may stop anytime, since lightning is common here. Donkey Live was also a waste of time, talking to Siri is funnier. Talking about the rides, who would want to wait like 60min in the heat for a 5 min ride? Arrived 30min early and waited to enter at 11am, the first ride still took 40min wait. There are Express tickets, but most rides are just normal roller coaster rides available in any amusement park, only a ride or 2 is special. Does these worth the extra money? hm... There are many people holding Express tickets, so Express lane also has a queue. Thought you rented a stroller so your young kid could rest while waiting? Sorry, you have to leave the stroller outside and queue. Singapore is hot all year round. And this is a small Universal Studio, very man-made, few trees around, making it especially hot, since there is also no wind.

6380,1,user_6341,"I have been one of the earliest visitors of the theme park when it first opened. I visited from Myanmar for it. Today i visited it park again for my Honeymoon, And i am sorry to say it was one of the worst experiences. 1. The waiting time and queues are mostly 2 hours for the main rides. How are guests supposed to cover the attractions? The closing time is so early at 6. The entire day is being spent standing in queues only whereas the Express pass guests get to go immediately. I tried buying an Express pass but it was sold out . But when i arrived I saw that Express queues are about 10 times shorter. For instance , for general guests we had to wait 120mins for BattleStar roller coaster - the Express is just about 10mins I strongly suggest you to increase the Express price to about 2 or 3 times the regular ticket and make the regular ticket a bit cheaper . In that way the regular ticket guests can have a better experience and those who want express service , can pay premium price for it. It seems guests who pay 82 for regular tickets are only visiting to suffer. And barely experience 2 or 3 main attractions in a day. And ideally the operating hours should be a little longer than current. It is impossible for guests to have a satisfactory day within 11am to 6pm. It feels like a giant waste of time and money to visit as a regular guest. 2. Customer service is so poor. The waiting times for the rides are highly inaccurate and unlike some other theme parks around the world - the waiting times are just shown outside before entering the attraction instead of also in some other points in the queue. The fans are shut in most areas where guests are queing outdoors. For instance i was 70mins queing in the outdoor area in the heat for Battlestar yet all the electric fans were shut. 3. Charging 5 for the drying pod outside the Jurassic world rapid adventures seems like a very lowly move. I understand there should be a nominal fee so that only guests who need it - use it but 5 for this is like a rip off . This is similar to how everything is overpriced in the theme park. A lot of guests visiting USS are foreigners but I am afraid to say USS brand image is not living up to expected standards. Piece of advice to visitors - dont visit if you do not get an Express pass . If they are sold out (because they are on quota) do not visit until u get it .",8/10/23,Weekday,1 hr,tolerance_collapse,50.0,dissatisfied,time_sensitive,0.8853,0.043000000000000003,0.5,0.9479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7351,0.091,0.3,0.9479,1,0,0,60,1.0,3,1,8,0.19166666666666665,0.9,1.0,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.02295980048772737,0.08,0.5,0.0,1.0

It feels like a punishment to stand in the queues everywhere for such long periods of time to enjoy the attractions if one doesn't have an Express pass. Suggestion: Proper seating arrangements should definitely be made in the waiting areas. 2. Due to this, even if one has reached early at 11 am at the opening time, it will be impossible to cover everything on a hoiliday by 6 pm when the Studios closes. 3. Entry passes are fixed to a single date. Anything can go wrong with anyone anytime and it is fully likely that due to those circumstances, one cannot make it on that particular day when the tickets are purchased. Suggestion: Passes should be open for 6 months or atleast a month. Tourists can then go to enjoy the attractions at their convenience in that time frame. 4. Express passes are not available online. Also, the price of those passes is more than the entry pass cost. Overall, after our visit to The Universal Studios, we remember our legs aching by standing in long queues MUCH MORE than the fun we got from the rides and the shows.

6421,1,user_6382,"The worst universal park ever... I have visited universal parks both in Orlando and Los Angeles, and I can easily say that this park has nothing to do with Universal. They have no idea how to manage the lines, the maintenance, etc. - The park is open only between 11am-6pm, even on a weekday, you can only visit max 3 rides because of the longest queues - The wait times are minimum 2 times more than whats written on the ride entries. - The lockers give you the option to use for free for only 80min, but the waiting time for a ride is around 150 min!! In reality it is more than 180 min! - They dont have max number of the tickets they sell on a daily basis, but they have limits for express. So, you will end up seeing zero queue for the express ride while 180 min for the normal line. This is unbelievable... They cant even do the maths to solve this imbalance issue. - The vip experience for 2 adults and 1 kid is more than 1200 dollars which is amazingly expensive - The money you pay is only for the park entry, because there is no way of you waiting in a line for 3 hours. Express ride option is more expensive than the ticket itself which clearly shows that the ticket price is for just walking around the park. - Even the restaurants or ice cream shops have very long queues, and you will also see there express lines are empty and the staff is not helping others even when empty - If you decide to buy express in the morning of the day you visit, you will see it is sold out and there is no way of buying it. You are basically trapped because you paid the tickets which are nonrefundable but then you will need to wait hours and hours for literally everything in the park. You can visit any other theme park globally, and this one will stay the worst experience ever. Dont even waste your time and money with this park. My daughter was so excited and waited for days, and in the second queue we were in - she decided to leave and see other places. She even says now she doesnt want to go to any universal park again.

6579,1,user_6537,"Without a doubt, of all the parks I have visited, this has been the worst in its classification as an experience. Negatives: -Up to more than 2 hours to get on an attraction. -Few bathrooms. You can pee waiting to get on an attraction. -The shows are poor and a bit boring. -Junk food and very expensive. Nor do they offer hardly any healthy food. -The park is not too big. -The park gets boring every time you have to wait. -Tremendous sounds from the expanding minions construction. -The operation of the lockers in some attraction creates a queue instead of making it simple and speeding up the process. -It closes too early and even if you go very early you will have a lot of waiting to get on the attractions. Even the simplest. -Too many people. The amount of people inside the park is overwhelming. -Bad organization by the park management. -Little variety of attractions and a bit old. -The que on after close park to take train its so long. Positive aspects: -The park is decently well-kept and there is no trash on the ground. -It is very easy to navigate. -If you like photography, it offers beautiful views with all the props and decorations. -The design of the park is beautiful. -The pets for kids. -Variety stores. In summary: I do not recommend visiting this park for the price of admission at the moment. It' boring cuz you have to wait a lot and everything is very slow. The shows are not good enough. Recommendations: -They should give a wake-up call to the entire management responsible for the park. It has many things to improve. -Its a bit scam to pay and not be able to enjoy. You can feel a bit frustrated or angry. -The number of people per day must be less so that the waiting lists at the attractions are not so long, although that means having to reserve the ticket time before. -The express pass is too expensive, 88 normal prize express (more than 100) so its around 200 each. Better separate the normal prize and the express. -Lower the price of food and improve the quality of food. -This park should add Singapour part that represent the culture and history of the country with nice rides and shows about country.

The Mummy, battlestar (besides the extremely rude ticket scanner guy at the cyclon) were awesome, transformers too. And then... one of my most anticipated Jurassic world this was so deflating. A dinosaur mall display would be more exciting. The dinosaurs hardly move, are falling apart and some werent even functioning. In conclusion, kids would like it but film fans looking for that Universal movie magic day would find it a very tired and somewhat sad experience. Its as if no one takes care of the park.

Your online tickets will have RFQ code but at the gate they cannot read it, they will ask you to issue tickets from the ticketing office with BAR code. That would take up to 60min on a weekday if you are lucky. 1-Try to be there before 11am to avoid any delays. 2-Download the Universal Studios Singapore app to track which attraction has how many minutes of waiting time. 3-The attractions are all close to each other, so, dont worry about losing any chance to ride any of your favorite attractions. 4-I highly recommend that you tour the attractions a day before on YouTube to check what you like and what you dont. 5-Start with the ride you like which has 40min or less waiting time. You will be able to get there faster than 40min. 6-I did not see it worth to buy the faster access which is S90.00 additional to your adult ticket (which is S82.00)!. 7-All attractions are accessible from outdoor so in any case have rain coats and be prepared for a rainy day. 8-We were able to ride 7 out of 9 rides we planned to ride. 9-It is worth visiting and you can still have some more time to spend your evening somewhere else inside Sentosa island or back to the city.

When you come out of the restroom, turn left a little beyond that and go straight until you reach the corner, there is a fairly large convenience store. I went on a weekday, but there were a lot of people, probably because it is a country where many travelers come from all over the world. Since the operating hours are short for a theme park, I recommend purchasing an express ticket, although it is expensive, if you want to enjoy everything, see everything, and ride the rides. If you can withstand UV rays, heat, and humidity for 1 to 2 hours and enjoy 2 minutes of happiness, you don't have to buy enough. And you can leave Universal and come back in. (You must stamp your arm before leaving) I think Pharaoh has such a strong impact... I recommend it!! Even though I went through the express line, I had to wait quite a while.

When we visited with our 5-year-old toddler, we couldn't resist joining in on the excitement ourselves. With so much to do inside, the limited operating hours from 11 am-6pm makes it challenging to experience everything. Despite the expensive base ticket prices of 80SGD for a child and 109SGD for an adult, additional costs of 70SGD per person for the Express pass might be necessary to avoid long queues, although it may not be valid for all rides. Setting aside the time constraint, the overall experience is incredibly immersive and inviting.

Also, would pay to give accurate wait times then give people the opportunity to continue to wait or abort. Or even better get staff to communicate proactively. Complete shambles. Also worth noting dont buy food there. Its terrible. Eat first. How hard is it to get good food? Sports stadiums can do it with basic food reasonably well, why cant universal?

The express tickets were all sold out which is equal to a normal ticket price. So basically paying double per person to access the rides quickly and not wait for 1 hour to access one ride.

6990,1,user_6944,"I recently visited Universal Studios in Singapore with my family and close family members with high hopes of an unforgettable day filled with excitement and adventure. Unfortunately, my experience was marred by one glaring issue: the absurdly long queues. It's disheartening to say that my overall impression of Universal Studios was one of frustration and disappointment. Upon arrival, it was immediately evident that the park was overcrowded. The lines for popular attractions stretched endlessly, resembling a never-ending labyrinth of waiting. It felt like the park management had completely overlooked the importance of efficient crowd control and guest satisfaction. Even with a carefully planned itinerary, I found myself spending the majority of my time (more than one or 2 hours)standing in lines rather than enjoying the attractions. It was disheartening to see families and children growing increasingly tired and restless while waiting for their turn, dampening the excitement that should have been synonymous with a theme park visit. To make matters worse, the queuing experience was poorly managed, resulting in excessive wait times that far exceeded any reasonable expectation. I understand that popular attractions will naturally attract larger crowds, but the sheer lack of organization and inefficiency at Universal Studios was astounding. As a paying customer, I expected a more seamless experience. I had eagerly anticipated immersing myself in the magical world of Universal Studios, but instead, I spent most of my time standing in line, growing increasingly disillusioned by the minute. I sincerely hope that Universal Studios addresses this significant issue and takes steps to improve their crowd management system. The park's reputation and the satisfaction of its visitors are at stake. Until then, I cannot recommend Universal Studios to anyone seeking a hassle-free and enjoyable theme park experience. In conclusion, my visit to Universal Studios was marred by interminable queues, overcrowding, and a lack of organization. The park failed to deliver on its promise of a thrilling and magical adventure, leaving me and my family with a sense of regret and frustration.

If it comes to a point that to enjoy the park entirely, you must buy the express pass which is literally paying the equivalent of another full price ticket just to finish all the rides, then in the first place what is the meaning of getting normal tickets at all? Say For a normal family of 4 who wants to enjoy the park fully, they will have to spend close to say SGD720 (including express passes) for a 7 hour session........?! This is assuming that they don't even take time for meals at all. The app wasn't accurate as well - we went to queue for a ride that said 20 min wait, but halfway into the queue, the physical signboard was changed to say 50 min while the app still said 20 min. Mel drive in burger only was 16 bucks but some Mcdonald gourmet burgers are bigger, juicier and better. And there were only 4 selection of burgers, a terribly limited menu. The pizza place was selling a large pizza at 50 bucks!!! I get that food in there is expensive, but it has gone ridiculously off the chart. Did we enjoy it? My girl who leveraged on the single rider lanes whenever they were opened went a few times on certain rides. But it wasn't possible to be able to experience everything. She was happy, but to me who's seen the park during the hey days with more rides yet somehow more time to cover most attractions, and food that were already expensive but still had some standards back then... nah, I think there are better places to spend the money. This was on a Thursday, school holiday yes but surprisingly, more tourists than locals.

7071,4,user_7024,"We had a good time in Universal in June 2023. However, some rides were not operating due to Cyclone prediction (in Jurassic Park), Jurassic Park Rapids, but a must try are- Battlestar Galactica (go only if u love adventure and if you are not scared of height), Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers-SD, Shrek show if you are Shrek lover like us:). Things to keep in mind- better to fix a meeting spot and time with your family, as you are not allowed to carry phone and other items with you, so, tracking becomes an issue. Take a locker, keep your belongings there, fix a meeting time & spot, so, that you all can meet after a few rides....full day is needed, so, better to start early, carry a water bottle as you need to walk alot, so, staying hydrated is must. Wear sneakers or comfortable shoes, in which you can walk more and more....wear a cap and sunglasses, wear lot of sunscreen, as it is sunny most of the time and everyone in the family, keep some cash, so, that, even if you are away from other members, you can enjoy the yum food in Universal. A must in your Singapore trip, though we had been to Ferrari world- Dubai, but this surely was fun. *Tips- You can take an express pass, if you do not like to wait much and ready to pay double the price, Express que is separate, but relatively less waiting.

One of the major highlights of the park is the various roller coasters that visitors can experience. The most popular roller coaster in the park is the Battlestar Galactica: Human vs Cylon, which is a dueling roller coaster that has two tracks. The ride is well-known for its intense and thrilling experience and is the perfect ride for adults and adventure lovers. Another popular roller coaster in the park is the Canopy Flyer. It is a suspended roller coaster that provides visitors with a bird's eye view of the park and the surrounding area. The ride is gentle and allows visitors to enjoy the scenery around them. Small children can also enjoy some of the rides in the park, such as the Treasure Hunters ride, which is a family-friendly roller coaster in which visitors ride along in a jeep. Another popular ride for young children is the Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase, which is a dark ride that takes visitors on a journey through space with Sesame Street characters. In conclusion, Universal Studios Singapore is an excellent destination for families and adventure lovers. It offers a range of roller coasters and other rides that cater to visitors of all ages.

7084,2,user_7037,"I visited Universal Studios Singapore today, and unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. The park is quite small, and the entrance fee is quite expensive, especially considering the limited number of attractions. Even on a Monday outside of the school holidays, the wait times for all the rides were long, ranging from 50 to 120 minutes. One major issue I noticed was the poor maintenance of the park. The exterior paintwork was faded, and many attractions had broken elements, from minor things like malfunctioning TV screens in the queues to more significant issues like the broken robot dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park ride. Furthermore, all the attractions in this park felt like inferior versions of similar rides in other parks worldwide. It seemed like little effort was made to provide something unique. Additionally, the toilets were unclean, and the food was expensive. The staff seemed to put minimal effort into ensuring efficient queue management. Platforms were overcrowded, and the staff was unfriendly on multiple occasions. It felt like they were simply going through the motions. One aspect that added to the frustration was the necessity to purchase an express pass. The regular queue lines moved at an excruciatingly slow pace, making it feel almost mandatory to buy an express pass to avoid spending the entire day waiting in line. Overall, I got the impression that little attention was given to visitor experience. Hopefully, the park can make improvements in the future to meet visitor expectations and enhance the overall quality of attractions and service.

7098,4,user_7051,"DETAILED REVIEW Second visit after 9 years. There isn't much of a difference. Offered rides are still the same. Except for two changes: Madagascar ride has been removed. I also saw a new ride in Shrek land. It is kid-friendly. They are now building a new section with Minions as the theme. Still has not been completed. For reference to travelers, presently, not all areas in the place are open. The restaurant in Jurassic Park and Mummy souvenir shop were closed. New rules for new travellers: (1) Place operates at new time from 11am to 6pm only (2) Express Unlimited is not applicable to all rides. There are 4 rides that you won't be able to use this privilege. If you are able to find it in your plans to arrive earlier, I suggest to add-on Express Unlimited instead of purchasing it online since it is more convenient: they give you a wrist band whereas if it is online, you need to constantly show your e-ticket bar code which can cause delays. The place is kid-friendly. There are enough rides, but of course, there are more adult rides. RIDES: 9 year difference and rides are practically the same. Most rides last for 5 minutes or less. If you're curious if Express Unlimited is worth it, it is IF you want to maximize your stay there and get the most out of the rides. Lines tend to be long despite how I came back on a weekday. This second experience was not as crowded as my first but there were still long queueing. If you're not the patient type then getting the express ticket is worth it, especially during peak season. FYI just like any other theme park anticipate that waiting for the rides would most likely take up majority of your stay if you choose to not take express ticket add-on. During our first time, we had to wait for as long as 2 hrs just to ride the Transformers. Lastly, many rides don't make use of Solo rider lines. I haven't even seen anyone make use of it as compared to my time during Disneyland. FOOD: don't expect much. It's tolerable enough to fill your stomach but it isn't good enough to match it's price point. If you're up for it, you can request to get a re-entry ticket and eat outside.",6/25/23,Weekday,1 hr,critical_tolerance,70.0,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,0.817,0.061,0.3333333333333333,0.9018,0.0,0.0,0.5423,0.111,-0.105,0.039999999999999994,0.0,0.9018,1,0,0,60,1.0,4,2,7,0.27307692307692305,0.95,1.0,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.04187014199509446,0.042,0.5,0.0,1.0

7122,2,user_7075,"It was an ok experience. I would have started with a poor rating but eventually with the time spend and realization how to navigate the experience improved a bit. A few suggestion to improve anyone's experience here- 1. Better go alone or with people who are of the same age, so that if you have a bad time it is a social experiment. 2. If you are going with kids and spending substantial money to get in, spend a bit more always get a express ticket to cut short the line time for the rides.(coz a kid would not understand that one needs to wait in queue to get a spot on the ride) 3.

I think I saw more people come out than go in for the ride. It felt very unprofessional and what about the elderly? This place is good but their prices are exorbitant and they charge more for express rides to get to rides faster but that queue is also pretty long. Waiting a long time for rides that are 5 to 10 minutes or even less is very time consuming. Now coming to the parts I did enjoy, the mummy ride was incredible. It was an indoor roller coaster ride. I liked the details put into the ride from the mummy movies. It would have been 5 stars if the queue was significantly shorter. Recommended if you want to experience this place and you can buy the express tickets. If not, it is pretty much impossible to explore most of the rides.

I highly recommend to book your ticket in advance to avoid the queue lines. The park will open at 11 am and closes at 7 pm or rather check the timeslot on their official website. Taking monorail, cable car and grab are the most easiest way to get to USS. Take the whole day tour to enjoy & experience USS, ride all the rides!

7313,4,user_7264,"Had lots of fun at USS! I went during the Singapore school holidays. Even though I didnt buy the express tickets, the queues were not as long as I expected and the longest I had to queue for was only 45min. The rest of the queues were much better and only took around 5-15min! Towards the end, at around 4pm, most of the people had left and there was barely any queues. Even though waterworld was not open, there was still a decent number of rides I could go on. I really enjoyed the roller coasters! For those tho like extreme rides, they are definitely recommended. But for those who are ok with a bit of extreme, but not too much, Mummy is a perfect ride. But I dont recommend Mummy to those who are scared of the dark. Transformers is a really thrilling 3D ride which is suitable for all ages. It is not scary but mainly exciting. Everyone should try transformers! As for Enchanted Airways I think is it alright for ages 7 and above. It honestly depends on how brave your child is It is actually a mini roller coaster and its super fun! I really enjoyed Canopy Flyer too! You can choose to either sit facing forwards or going backwards. The view is really nice from up there and I recommend to everyone! Lastly, there is the Jurassic water ride . (Im not sure what its called) A super thrilling and exciting ride where you are seated with a few other people in this circle like boat. Then, you will go down a river with occasional waterfalls, small drop-downs and dinosaurs which spray water at you! At the very last part, there is a pretty big drop that will get everyone soaked!! (If you want to go on this ride but you do not want to get wet, I recommend bringing your own raincoat! Because the raincoats they sell there are super expensive at 5SGD each!!) I would definitely recommend eating outside of USS (for example at the malaysian food centre) because the food and drinks inside USS are really expensive! One small bottle of drinking water can be 4SGD and one cup of slushee was around 8-12SGD Lets not talk about how expensive the food was too. The staff were really friendly overall but there was one time when it was my turn to go on the Human roller coaster, the staff which helps scan our pockets was not so friendly. After she had scanned my pockets, I kindly asked her if I could sit at the last row but she looked irritated and just nodded her head. The second time I went on Human, I also asked if I could sit at the last row again. This time, the lady literally rolled her eyes at me and didnt even reply me. I was super disappointed and really annoyed at her behavior. After that, I didnt want to go on Human again because of that staff. But overall, the rest of the staff were friendly and helpful! Another recommendation I have for those who have not visited before is to arrive about an hour before the park opens. This way, you can quickly queue at the gate and you would be one of the first few people to enter the park. Then you can quickly rush to the rides so that you would not have to queue so much at the beginning. Overall, I had a really great time at USS. I definitely recommend coming here. If you are afraid that there would be many people, I think you should really get the express unlimited tickets. You would be able to go on the rides many more times. :)",6/8/23,Weekday,Up to 10 min,high_tolerance,25.344000000000005,very_satisfied,time_tolerant,-0.103,0.005999999999999998,0.17777777777777778,0.9524,0.0,0.0,0.7549,0.062,0.0,0.141,1.8,0.9991,1,0,0,5,1.0,6,2,8,0.340625,0.95,1.0,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.203,0.5,0.0,0.08333333333333333

From the moment I stepped foot into the park, I was transported into a world of magic and wonder. Universal Studios Singapore truly lives up to its reputation as one of the most exciting theme parks in the world. First and foremost, the park's attention to detail is simply astounding. Every corner of Universal Studios Singapore is meticulously designed to recreate the iconic movie sets and bring them to life. The themed areas, such as Hollywood, New York, and Ancient Egypt, are so immersive that you feel like you're actually in those places. The park's vibrant atmosphere and beautifully landscaped surroundings add to the overall charm. The rides at Universal Studios Singapore are nothing short of thrilling. From heart-pounding roller coasters like Battlestar Galactica: Human vs. Cylon and Revenge of the Mummy, to family-friendly adventures like Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure and Transformers: The Ride, there is something for everyone. The attention to detail in each attraction is remarkable, making the experience even more enjoyable. One of the highlights of my visit was the spectacular live shows. The Waterworld show, in particular, left me in awe with its breathtaking stunts and special effects. The performers were incredibly talented, and the entire production was a true spectacle. The other shows, such as the Hollywood Dreams Parade and the Sesame Street Stage Shows, were equally entertaining and showcased the park's commitment to providing diverse and high-quality entertainment for all ages. Food and dining options in Universal Studios Singapore were impressive as well. There is a wide range of cuisines available, from local Singaporean delights to international favorites. I particularly enjoyed the themed restaurants that provided an immersive dining experience, such as the Jurassic Park-themed restaurant. The quality of the food was excellent, and the service was friendly and efficient. Universal Studios Singapore also caters to families with young children. There are numerous attractions and shows designed specifically for kids, including the adorable Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase and the Shrek 4-D Adventure. The park's commitment to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for families is commendable. In terms of operations and organization, Universal Studios Singapore excelled. The park was clean, well-maintained, and the staff members were friendly and helpful. The queue management system was efficient, minimizing waiting times and maximizing enjoyment. The overall experience was seamless and stress-free. In conclusion, Universal Studios Singapore is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a thrilling and unforgettable adventure. The park's attention to detail, incredible rides, spectacular shows, and diverse dining options make it a truly world-class theme park.

First of all no matter which pass you buy, You will not enjoy, because almost every ride has a waiting of nearly 1 to 2 hours minimum. Secondly if it rains which is very common in Singapore, the money you spent is a total waste. As they shut all the rides. They have locker system, which they give for 40 mins free, but since every ride has a waiting of nearly 2 hours. You end up paying the fees after 40 mins. Which makes no sense. Rides aren't that great. The one's that are mostly shut all time. If the park is flooded like this, none can enjoy. A sheer waste of money.

Located on Sentosa Island in Singapore, the park is a must-visit for anyone looking for a fun and exciting day out. One of the highlights of Universal Studios Singapore is the range of thrilling rides that are available. Whether you're a fan of roller coasters, water rides, or 4D simulators, there's something for everyone. One must-try ride is Battlestar Galactica: Human vs. Cylon, a pair of intertwined roller coasters that twist and turn at high speeds. It's an exhilarating experience that's sure to get your heart racing. In addition to the rides, Universal Studios Singapore also offers a range of shows and attractions that are just as impressive. The Waterworld show, based on the Kevin Costner film of the same name, is a must-see, with jaw-dropping stunts and special effects. The Hollywood Dreams Parade, which takes place in the evening, is also a highlight, with colorful floats and beloved characters from movies and TV shows.

7623,5,user_7569,"Universal Studio Singapore is undoubtedly one of the best amusement parks to visit in Southeast Asia. With its wide range of thrilling rides and attractions, it has become a top tourist destination for families and friends alike. I recently had the opportunity to visit the park, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience. The first thing that struck me about Universal Studio Singapore was its impressive collection of rides. From heart-pumping roller coasters to interactive simulators, there was something for everyone. One of my personal favorites was the Transformer ride, which was an incredible 3D experience that transported me into the world of the Autobots and Decepticons. It was so realistic that I felt like I was part of the action. However, it's worth noting that the park can get quite crowded on weekends and holidays. This can lead to long wait times for the rides and difficulty navigating through the crowds. However, if you plan your visit during the weekdays, the park is significantly less crowded, and you can enjoy all the rides and attractions without having to wait in long lines. Despite the crowds, the overall atmosphere of the park is infectious. There's a palpable energy and excitement in the air that is hard to describe. The park is immaculately maintained, and the staff is friendly and helpful. One downside to visiting Universal Studio Singapore is that you'll need a full day to enjoy everything the park has to offer. In fact, it took me around six hours to explore the entire park and experience all the rides. That said, it's worth every minute, as the memories you'll make here are priceless. In conclusion, if you're looking for a fun-filled adventure, Universal Studio Singapore is an absolute must-visit. The park's fantastic rides, thrilling attractions, and energetic atmosphere make it a unique and unforgettable experience.

7670,5,user_7616,"An excellent day with the kids. Straight up, we paid for Universal Express Unlimited (UXU) passes, and we believe that they were worth every cent. The park was quiet (we went on a Thursday outside of SG school holiday) but there were still queues. The UXU passes got us to the front of the line without any wait almost every time. The kids got to enjoy front row seats on all the main rides multiple times throughout the day. And by multiple times I literally mean dozens... something that was only possible thanks to the UXU passes. I know that the cost of the UXU passes makes many question their value, but in hindsight we all agree that having them made the day truly spectacular. And to top it off, the passes also get you through the priority entrance at the front gates too, another bonus! The USS App was very useful for navigating. Strongly recommend that you download. The park is relatively small, and Waterworld remains closed at time of writing, which was sad. But that said, we spend the entire day there and only stopped for lunch! Understanding the locker system and using them efficiently is key to enjoying the day too. Can get a bit painful. But once you know the rules and get to know where the various banks of lockers are, then it all gets a bit easier. Drink outlets all sell the same, basically coke, lemonade, water and coconut water. Few other options but not much. Don't expect gourmet food, but it was fine, and the kids just wanted to get back to the rides anyway, so that was fine!

To ride an attraction with an express pass, you wait in line for an average of 1 hour. There is no question of riding something twice there is no desire to stand in line for an hour a second time. And you stand in line in super tight corridors. I can't breathe. There are a lot of people. It is unclear how much longer to wait. At some point, after standing in line for an hour and already seeing the entrance to the attraction, it was simply closed. Because there were clouds in the sky and there was a risk of lightning. When we went outside, it turned out that at that moment all the attractions that were on the street were closed . Unreasonably expensive!!! Due to the fact that there are no restrictions on the number of visitors, there is just a mess of people there. Nobody really has time to look at anything. Even to buy water you have to stand in a huge line. I do not recommend visiting. A waste of money and nerves.

Towards the end, there was no queue at all, with or without pass. Also another tip : early in morning the Transformer and Sesame street have huge lines, as they are right near entrance. At the end of they day, there was no queue here. The wait times of rides on other end of park like the mummy ride and jurassic park are low in beginning and high later. So if u come early (11-11:30 ish) start from other end of park and walk towards the entrance. The adventurous rides are mummy (we did 3 times), transformers, Jurassic park, and roller coaster. Accelerator ride, Canopy ride, and enchanting airways are medium adventure. Rest rides maybe good, but u wont get adrenaline rush. Light Camera action was the best show. For Jurassic park, canopy ride, and Revenge of mummy ride, u need to remove all bags and put it in a locker. Rent is 4 near jurassic park, and free for mummy ride for first 45 mins.

Therefore, may I ask 61/adult that I paid just for 2 RIDES? Do you all think its worth? If you closed many rides like that you should change/discount the ticket price instead.

'Transformers The Ride' is the most innovative, 'Revenge of the Mummy' has the best theme, and the 'Battlestar Galactica' looks most iconic on the outside with its two intertwining tracks. Furthermore, I really liked the Shrek themed area, Far Far Away. Not so much because of the attractions, but mainly because of the atmosphere. Just like Singapore itself, every square meter of the park has its purpose. Every attraction is always within a few minutes walking distance. This makes the visit not as exhausting as visiting other amusement parks. Unlike Singapore, the food was expensive and did not look that good. Tip: go outside of the park to have lunch in the area just outside of Universal Studios. You can leave and come back for free, and the food outside is tastier and less expensive. The park is building new areas, which is needed because the current attractions might become a little outdated in the coming years.

Just wonderful.... but the only reason I have given it a rating of 4 stars is cause of the way the place is crowded and the wait time for certain rides can easily reach 90 minutes, it's jus not worth waiting for that amount of time. That's the reason the studios have an option of charging people an extra fare for express visits on all the rides which is charged more than the actual ticket price. Tip : You may not like waiting n want to rush through rides, think about it before entering the studios and upgrade your ticket to express visits.

Even if you go on weekdays, it is still recommended to buy a fast pass. Because tourists from all over the world gather here, many people buy fast passes, so they still have to queue for 20 minutes or more. But there is no fast pass and you have to wait in line for more than an hour. Be prepared to queue. The landscaping in the Egyptian area is very atmospheric, and the majestic mummy landscape looks great no matter how you take photos. The castle and pea tree landscape of Far Far Away Kingdom are a great way to turn fairy tales into reality. Each amusement facility is unique and full of sincerity. They dont just run once or twice and then end. Each one leaves people wanting more. There are various roller coasters, some with story plots, some with 4D, and they have twists and turns, giving people wave after wave of surprises. It is really fun. Appreciating the movie scene, I originally thought it was nothing special, but this is the most amazing thing. It is definitely not necessary to make this trip, you must play it. Although the Cylon roller coaster can rotate 360 degrees, it is actually similar to a human roller coaster and is not that scary.

Unless there is a generous discount, best to buy your tickets on the day so you don't end up going to a largely outdoor theme park on a rainy day. They also close rides when it rains so even if you get in, there won't be much to do. We also bought Express tickets at the gate to skip lines, and I realized later that you can also buy them inside. That's a better option because when the lines and waits are manageable, you can save yourself between 60 or 90 (we paid for this unlimited option). We were here about 8 years ago I think, and sadly, not much has changed. Noticed some of the restaurants are closed, and stalls too. Plus, Waterworld was closed, and most of another section. I wish theme parks whose rides are not fully available would give 10 to 20 food vouchers at the gate on that day to visitors to make up for the disappointment.

The park is relatively small, and compared to Overseas, you can explore all zones when you arrive. Suggested duration - You will be in the USS for over 3 hours. First issue: Waiting time - expect to wait more than 30 minutes or longer for popular rides. Second issue: Quality of the rides - if you have seen the latest Universal studio movies, the rides are during the first -release. Such as Shriek in the movie, Transformers. The mummy - when it was the first release. It is not the latest. The cost of the food. It is not justified - it might be cosier than buying the merchandise.

Do not visit during holidays because you will not be able to ride most rides because your time will be spent queuing and believe me it could take over an hour. If you can afford it get the fast pass. Kids and adults will enjoy the place. I highly recommend you try discovery cove too. Also within Sentosa just across Universal Studios. It is an extra ticket separate from universal studios. You will enjoy the slides and pools here. Do not miss the chance to snorkel with the fishes! You can also get a bus ride to another part of Sentosa and try the Skyline Luge.

8469,3,user_8405,"There are some good attractions, that's for sure. But the customer is considerably neglected, given the price of entry, and even more so the fast pass. I hesitated a lot to buy it (family of 5, it's a budget!), and I ultimately didn't take it because we came on a weekday outside of school holidays. (Please note that you can buy it once there if necessary if you are hesitant). There are quite a few people but it's manageable (up to 50 minutes for certain attractions, or even a little more at the end of the day). You should carefully check the waiting times for attractions with the park app throughout the day. Times can vary quite a bit from one attraction to another throughout the day. So adapt your program accordingly. The most disappointing thing is that they don't always put wait times correctly. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's not. Avoid backpacks as much as possible because some attractions (especially thrill rides) prohibit it and you will have to waste time putting your bags in lockboxes which may be chargeable depending on the time and/or the attraction you are doing. I would have avoided taking one if I had known. Overall, on a day like today (3/16/23), you can do almost all the interesting attractions (by which I mean either thrill rides if that's your thing, or softer ones, especially for young children). It's difficult, however, to do everything without the fastpass, even without a lunch break). If you don't have much time, or you prefer to pay the price to get the most out of it, don't hesitate to take the fastpass unlimited. Wifi is much appreciated to help pass the time in queues. The food there is quite expensive and not particularly good quality. (It is normally forbidden to bring food). For thrill rides, I recommend in order: Transformers, Battle Stars Cyclone, Revenge of the Mummy, Jurrassic Park Rapid Adventure. Shrek 4d and adventures airways aren't bad either.

The other high speed roller coaster worth your time is in the Pharoah themed land. 3. If you see a long waiting time for these rides, don't waste your time. Instead, go to these rides 45-30 minutes before the studio closes for the day so that you don't have to wait along with the tourists. 4.

8922,2,user_8853,"I went to Halloween Horror Nights 2022 and it was so poorly organised it was awful and at times dangerous. The night started off by letting everyone in but not any further than the Main Street, which resulted in thousands of people crowded into the street crushing each other as people kept trying to move forward. This disaster waiting to happen was all so people could watch a show that only the few people at the very front could see or hear (they didnt even have speakers down the street). We stood for twenty minutes in this crush of people, in the intense heat with no airflow (since Main Street is covered), and when they finally opened the park properly after the show people just took off, shoving and running with some literally tripping over each other. Inside was pretty underwhelming as there were no decorations throughout the park, not even projections. It was also SO hot, everywhere! The park is crowded with buildings and the streets are covered in areas so there is no airflow. The water from the water bottle filling stations is even hot. The only places with air conditioning are a couple of restaurants. When we got in the lines at least werent as bad as people said, so we only waited an hour in line rather than 2-4 like we expected. The haunted houses were good, but youre through in less than ten minutes. The scare zones were okay but even shorter. And that was all there was to do unless you wanted to wait over 2 hours to go on one of the regular rides. There was one quick show but it was shortly after the park opened so we missed it while waiting in line for a haunted house. We paid extra for the behind the scenes tour which cost as much as park entry and took less than half an hour. This was the most underwhelming part as it was just looking at 3 costumes, seeing some optical illusion equipment, a very cool but quick dance group dressed as zombies, and a haunted maze that was just a few metres of scary props.

We played the first 3 and almost vomited. Transformers, we lost to 5D a lot. We went out to rest and eat burgers. Continue with the rides in the Egyptian zone. Nothing at all. This one is very funny. For small children, it would be more appropriate than the name treasure hunt. Continuing on with the rides that we thought the kids were going to have, the dragons took them on a roller coaster. We like the Egyptian zone, take beautiful photos. Forget to look and see if there is a souvenir shop in the Egyptian area. But the restaurant is beautiful. Some restaurant sections are a bit too small. Because there are a lot of tourists Even on weekdays When we eat, we feel hungry at the same time. Every store is full. Luckily we were hungry a while ago so we had a seat Traveling alone, I don't get many photos. But overall I really like it. Come capture the atmosphere. P.S. You can buy your own USS entrance ticket through the vending machine in front of the entrance. In simple English, we pay by credit card. On the way, take bus number 123 from Hotel Mirama.

9229,5,user_9153,"Universal Studios Singapore (abbreviation: USS) is a theme park located within Resorts Universal Sentosa in Sentosa, Singapore. It includes 28 rides, shows and entertainment destinations in seven themed areas. It is one of six Universal Studios theme parks around the world. It was a key component of Genting Singapore's bid to gain the right to build Singapore's second integrated resort (IR). On 8 December 2006, the Singapore government announced that the consortium had won the bid. Construction of the theme park and the rest of the resort began on April 19, 2007. It is the second Universal Studios theme park in Asia, the other being Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, and the first in Southeast Asia. Official plans for the park were first revealed to the public when Universal Studios Singapore released a map of the entire park on October 20, 2009. [1] Universal Studios Singapore attracted more than 2 million visitors in the nine months of its opening. [2] The park officially began operations on May 28, 2011. More than 3 million guests visited the park in its opening year. Since then, Universal Studios Singapore has received approximately 4 million visitors every year. Most visitors are local Singaporeans as well as tourists from other Asian countries in the area. It was marketed by Universal Parks & Resorts as a ""unique theme park in Asia"" and that the park was the only one of its kind in Southeast Asia for the foreseeable future. [3] According to the AECOM Theme Index Global Attendance Report, Universal Studios Singapore is one of the best visited theme parks/theme parks worldwide amendment Construction of Resorts World Sentosa and Universal Studios Singapore began on April 19, 2008. After nearly two years of construction, the park opened on March 18, 2010. Universal Studios Singapore was opened for a ""sneak peek week"" in light of Chinese New Year celebrations, from 5pm to 9pm every night between 14 and 21 February 2010. [5] Although visitors had to pay S10 to enter the park even though the rides were not operating, tickets for the week sold out in two days. On March 5, 2010, it was announced that the park would open at 8:28 a.m. (UTC8) on March 18, 2010 for the soft opening phase. As of March 13, 2010, Resorts World Sentosa team members and their families have had the opportunity to visit the park before the public has the opportunity to do so. [6] The park had a soft opening period from March 18, 2010 to October 26, 2010. [7] The park's official grand opening was held on May 28, 2011, along with a ""Grand Opening Ceremony"" held on the evening of May 27, 2011. There were Asian personalities Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Chow Wei, and former American Idol judge Paula Abdul, who appeared at the ceremony, along with about 1,600 guests.

9233,1,user_9157,"I probably just came here on a bad day because I left pretty disappointed. I came to Singapore Universal Studios a lot of times in the past but I can tell their standard has dropped quite a lot. Firstly, the transformers ride broke down not once, but twice! The first time I was in the roller coaster itself when it suddenly stopped working. We had to wait in our seats for a pretty long time (20 minutes)I did not queue too long for the ride because I went for the single rider line but I still waited for about 30 minutes before boarding the ride. There were people beside me that waited up to 100 minutes just for the ride to break down! Luckily the staff gave everyone a one time express ticket that could be used for other rides but honestly, I just wished that the ride was working. The second time happened when we were queuing. We decided to return to give the transformers ride another chance by queuing again. We queued for another 30 mins and right before we could board the ride, an announcement came informing us that the ride broke down AGAIN. We had to leave again disappointed as the transformers ride was one of my favourites. The food choices in USS was also pretty bad. The food tastes mediocre and extremely expensive! I recommend all of you to leave USS and eat at other restaurants that Sentosa has and return after you finished eating. Would not recommend eating in USS itself. Also the Madagascar ride and Waterworld is unavailable as the Madagascar ride is being changed into a minion ride. Waterworld used to be one of my favourite shows in USS but for some reason, they closed it Overall, I am extremely disappointed in USS, which used to be my favourite theme park.",1/7/23,Weekday,1030 min,tolerance_collapse,15.552,dissatisfied,time_tolerant,0.8639,0.066,0.35294117647058826,-0.7495,0.0,0.0,-0.6046,-0.051,0.0,0.0,0.6,-0.7495,1,0,0,20,1.0,2,2,5,0.2555555555555556,0.8,1.0,1,0.2691427382438618,1.0,1.0,0.23429938704988132,0.072,0.5,0.0,0.3333333333333333

There seem to be a lot of people when you enter, but how do you get on? There are fewer people around 3 or 4 p.m., so it's good. Just buy the admission ticket and eat with that money.

If you don't purchase an Express ticket, you may have to wait in line for 2-3 hours on some rides. If you're only going to be able to ride a few stations, boredom will replace the fun. And that day will be the day you are not impressed. The most impressive player Egypt looks like a museum at first glance. But once you enter, it becomes an extremely thrilling roller coaster. Adding to the fear of darkness It's a plaything that isn't child friendly at all. Please prepare yourself for the thrill and fear first. Transformers the ride is a simulator that projects 3D images as if we were actually in the vehicle. It is very fun and realistic. Human vs. Cylon, this one is the most brutal, a rollercoaster. Human rides on a train, while Cylon hangs his legs and plays with his hands completely numb. The greatest thrill has to be these two. The three types above are my favorites, but there are many others that I'm also impressed by. But if you don't want to lose your temper and waste all day waiting in line.

They are a bit expensive, but so it's more practical if you want to drop off your luggage. The park is definitely much smaller than that in Japan. Nevertheless, you can have a lot of fun.

9521,5,user_9441,"Universal Studios is a one of a kind experience in Singapore. It is on every traveller's list by default. Do not miss their special rides - Transformers, Ripples, The mummy ride and the 2 roller coasters. Book tickets in advance on Klook. Express entry tickets help you tour the entire park in a day's time, otherwise making it impossible to cover everything. If you're pressed for time, do opt for the express entry pass. Unless you're very keen on repeating rides, do not go for an unlimited ticket. Food options for vegetarians is very limited and equally expensive. We found an Afghani restaurant serving veg biriyani at SGD16 per plate! The number of restaurants inside the theme park seem to have significantly reduced over time, only adding to wait time and longer queues in the ones open. Keep some finger food handy for emergencies. Lots of options for souvenirs as well - every ride exit lands you into one! But the collection you find here is very unique and not available in the local markets of Singapore. So try to finish everything by 5 p.m and spend some quality time in these shops. Every ride, every shop and every eatery closes at 6 p.m sharp, so last minute hurry can be avoided with better planning.

Especially thrilling with their roller coaster rides with theme of their characters or shows. There are lot of live activities by the characters themselves and allow you to click pics with them, with a good thing also being you can click using your own camera or phone as well apart from their official click. While their entrance ticket gives entry to pretty much all the attractions, a special pass called Express Pass will help you skip the long waiting lines of upto 40-60 mins on some of the attractions, especially the fast moving rides. You can buy the Express Pass over the counter which costs SGD 50 for one time use for applicable shows but can cost lesser sometimes if booked online.

It's been awhile since i went to USS for the daytime fun as past few years have only been attending the HHN instead. So it was some awesome time spent with loved ones. We got there about noon and still managed to get on the major rides and some of the lesser known ones. So for those who wants to cover all the rides, it's best to come early from their opening hours at 11am. And if you have the budget, get the express entry for all these rides. Of all the major rides, i loved the Cylon (Battlestar Galactica), Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers and the jurassic park rapids adventure. The jurassic park one is slightly different from the one at universal hollywood. From the size of the boat to some parts of the ride itself. But it is still a thrilling one nonetheless. The cylon was such a crazy one. The adrenaline rush is mind blowing. Likewise for the mummy and transformers too. For those who are more on the timid side, they can try the treasure hunter or the accelerator. For quite the movie experience, visit the lights, camera, action to feel the wrath of a cat 4 typhoon but be careful as you may get wet. Or for quite the ""ride"" shrek 4d is another favourite. I didn't get to ride some of the other rides due to time constrained and also was getting tired and just wanna hang out at the beach after that. While some parts are closed for renovation/upgrades.

Revenge of the mummy is a must ride for the ultimate tossing around of your tummy. For the ultimate thrill seekers, go for Battlestar Galactica Cyclone. Buy an 'Express pass' as it'll help to cut a minimum wait of 1 hour or more on queues on any one ride of your choice. You can use your Express pass only ONCE. There's this 'Unlimited pass' which also which gives you unlimited access without any queues to any ride.

10143,5,user_10058,"Well worth a visit. Had a lot of fun here. Express passes are definitely worth it if you can afford it. The passes are on a dynamic pricing system. So prices will increase as demand increases or as the park gets busier. There are two types of express pass. One is for unlimited rides (90) and the other is express pass for one ride each (60), ie ie you can only fast pass each ride once. A wrist band is issued for unlimited rides and a ticket is issued for ""single"" express pass where the rides are ticked off when used. Our group picked the single fast pass and then was told four of the fast pass rides were closed so we were able to ""replace"" those with other rides that we liked. We got in just after 12, left at closing and struggled to go on all the rides. Can't imagine the productivity if there was no express pass when queues are 1-2 hours long. Free lockers are provided for some of the roller-coaster which means waiting can seem longer without a phone.

Good place to spend and kids would love the shows. The souvenir shops are great and you get to purchase good merchandise and chocolates. Cons: Rides are relatively few and many are usually shut down. Some of the 4d experiences are quite ordinary. If you are someone that has experienced Dubai park. This is a definite letdown.

So, if someone gets dizzy easily, it's best to ask the staff first and choose a ride that's light.

Everything is done really well and into the details. Some disadvantages: 1) Some of the rides might be closed randomly on days you come. You just have to find out(no worries though, the main ones are active) 2) I visited on a a moderately low day. In high season waiting can be over an hour and even longer for most rides. Honestly I dont think the most are worth waiting more than 45 minutes tops except for the top best rides. But thats a more personal thing. 3) The park is real fun, but having said point number 2, the best of the park really comes down to 3-4 rides (for those who love the adrenaline), which are always really busy and waiting is long.

Maybe worth it if you have express pass but will cost you nearly a full ticket extra. Biggest thing that upset me the most is their money grabbing scheme with lockers.

10548,5,user_10457,"When coming to Universal Studios, it is recommended to buy priority access tickets. Otherwise, in Singapores weather, you will have to queue for several hours for each item and then the game will end in 1 to 3 minutes. There is really no experience at all. Although priority tickets are expensive, without priority tickets, it is almost impossible to experience most of Universal Studios' projects in one day, especially on weekends and holidays. Relatively speaking, the two types of priority tickets can only be used once for all items (except for a few). The unlimited priority tickets are not necessary unless you particularly love one of the items. The Battlestar Coaster is definitely the flagship of all the roller coaster projects at Universal Studios. If there are no health risks, this project is 100% recommended to experience. Of course, this project is also one of the projects with the largest queues (there is also a project with a large number of people queuing for Jurassic World Ride, which I personally think is very average). There is a sister roller coaster next to this roller coaster (red track), which has a lower difficulty level (no 360-degree rotation). Friends who want to ride a roller coaster but are afraid of it can experience this roller coaster first, and then consider whether to go to the Ace Coaster for fun. There is the only Starbucks not far from the entrance of the park. The other restaurants in the park can only be said to be quite satisfactory. The taste and price are not far different from those outside the scenic area. At least it is enough to satisfy your appetite. Compared with the catering in a certain country's scenic area, it is simply too conscientious. Compared with Universal Studios in other countries, the projects are single and the area is much smaller. It is also unbelievable that some products, including the parks sales stores, are out of stock. However, Universal Studios Singapore is still highly recommended as one of the must-see attractions when traveling to New Zealand.

You can expect queue time of around 1 hr for each of these rides. The queue time will be lesser during evenings. Otherwise you can spend extra to get an express pass to skip the queue. These attractions are the first ones which come up as we walk through Universal Studios and so the queues are also long during the first half of the day.

Few tips I would like to share which I knew earlier which helped me a lot. 1. Bring some food. I would say a lot . You would be a very very hungry during all the rides and the food inside is bit costly 2. Take a big bottle of water. Be hydrated all the time. There is dispenser and wash rooms all over the place 3. Check your locker timing. After 120 minutes it's chargeable. So what you can do is takeout your stuff and place again with different a locker 4. Go for rollercoaster first. It will remain busy until the end. So be sure you make it there within the first few. Then comeback and enjoy the rest 5. I will suggest you take an express pass. But I found it useless if you are travelling alone or you guys have the vibe of going to every rides alone then you can save around 60 to 70 SGD. There is a line for single riders which is pretty quicker than express pass. But keep in mind it will not work in rollercoaster. 6. I would suggest you allways take someone with you so that you have someone who can take pictures for you since there is a lot to click. Also take a selfie stick which cost hardly 3 SGD. This also gives you a good company. 7.

Or they rotate the rides, as in some available earlier half and others in the later half. Each rides a min. of 45min to 1hr 15min. Trying to find a place to feed the kids were also a nightmare cause only limited outlets are open. The que is super long. I enter when the place opened.

Queued for up to 45minutes for one of the roller coaster and they announced that the ride is suspended due to a lighting warning. However the ride was reopened not long after and managed to try it with relatively shorter queue.

10724,4,user_10632,"We went in around 12:30. It's quite expensive, but it's a lot of fun. A lot of people were going around clockwise at first, so we went around from the left. We waited almost 100 minutes for Transformers at first, but when we went around 4:30, we were able to ride in 5 minutes. We waited almost 70 minutes for Battlestar Galactica until around 5:00, but when we went around 5:45, we were able to ride the one with our feet not dangling in about 40 minutes. We waited almost 80 minutes for the one in Jurassic Park that gets wet from around 2:00, but when we went around 6:45, we were able to ride in 15 minutes. The wait time for Revenge of the Mummy was about 30 minutes until around 2:00, but when we went at 2:20, we waited 60 minutes. We lined up alone next to a stranger and were able to ride in 10 minutes. If you go counterclockwise, you can ride the Puss in Boots attraction in 10 minutes, but if you go around 2 p.m., you'll have to wait for nearly 50 minutes. At first, I had to wait about 60 minutes for Sesame Street, but when I went around 5 p.m., I was able to ride in about 20 minutes. I was able to ride Shrek in about 15 minutes. I was able to ride the merry-go-round in about 10 minutes, and I was able to ride the merry-go-round with the penguins that I was looking forward to. Now I'd like to announce my rankings. 1st place: Revenge of the Mummy It was great with its unpredictable movements and thrills. 2nd place: Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure It was a little dizzying, but the thrill of not knowing when you'll get wet was great. 3rd place: Battlestar Galactica I was nervous at first, but when I got on, it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. 4th place: Puss in Boots It wasn't thrilling, but the view was nice. 5th place: Transformers the Ride It was exciting and great 6th place: Shrek It was exciting and great. 7th place: Sesame Street I was glad to see Elmo. 8th place: Coffee Cup It was dizzying, but fun. 9th place: Merry-go-round It was great that there were so many different shapes. It was pretty crowded. I wish they'd add more attractions.

This is probably the smallest US studio so there isn't much and the ride don't change that much either and best to go in good weather or bring umbrella as there's not a lot of rain cover if it does rain which tends to happen. The Battlestar Galactica and Rise of the Mummy is quite worth it to go and play. Food is quite expensive here and not all great. Toy store is quite good. There's also a regular parade which is fun.

The line is quite fast. The scale felt the same or smaller than Lotte World. Because it is a franchise, the prices are quite expensive.

Apart from these inconveniences, the park is nice to visit once with the children but a second time would certainly be too much. The attractions are rather successful (big plus for the Transformers attraction) even if the waiting times are worthy of Disneyland. You have to buy the fastpass for the day to be profitable but this makes for a very expensive entry for rather limited content. I only tried one fast restaurant there. I was extremely disappointed. The nuggets were of low quality, and the ""hotdog"" that was served to me did not deserve to end its life in my stomach but rather in a trash can. When you visit a culinary city like Singapore, it must be said that you fall from a very high place. It's best to bring your own food or eat at one of the restaurants outside the park.
